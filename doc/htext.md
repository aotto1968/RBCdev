htext \- Create and manipulate hypertext widgets  

SYNOPSIS
========

__htext__ *pathName* ?*option* *value*?\.\.\.  

DESCRIPTION
===========

The __htext__ command creates a new window (given by the *pathName* argument)
and makes it into a __htext__ widget\.  Additional options, described above,
may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
configure aspects of the widget such as its color and font\.  At the
time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
*pathName*, but *pathName*\'s parent must exist\.  The __htext__ command returns
its *pathName*\.  

The __htext__ widget is hybrid of a non\-editable text widget and a geometry
manager (e\.g\. the packer)\.  It displays text (optionally read from
file) in a window\.  Text can be scrolled either horizontally or
vertically using the __htext__ window as a viewport\.  In addition, Tcl
commands can be embedded into the text which are evaluated as the text
is parsed\.  Text between special double characters (percent signs "%%")
is immediately passed to the Tcl interpreter for evaluation\.

Furthermore, any widget or widget hierarchy can be packed in\-line and
made to appear on the current line of the text\.  Widgets are packed
using the __htext append__ command\.  All widgets must be children of the
__htext__ window and must already exist before packing\.  Once a widget has
been packed it cannot be moved to a different position within the text\.
Widgets can be resized but they will remain at the same position within
the text\.  

Before a file or text string is parsed by the __htext__ widget, all the
widget\'s current children are destroyed\.  You can reload files or text
without worrying about unmapping or destroying each child window
beforehand\.  

Setting the either the __\-file__ or __\-text__ configuration option will adjust
the value of the other\.  If both options are set, the file takes
precedence\.  When a new file is read using the __\-file__ option, the value
of the __\-text__ option is reset to the empty string\.  Likewise, when the
__\-text__ option is set, the string representing the __\-file__ option is
cleared\.  

FILE FORMAT
===========

The format of __htext__ text file is typically ASCII text\.  Text enclosed
by special double characters (by default, percent signs \'%%\') is
interpreted and executed as Tcl commands\.  The special character  may
be specified by the __\-specialchar__ option\.  In the following example of a
__htext__ file,  a button widget is appended to the text between  the words
"a" and "which"\.  The *pathName* of the __htext__ widget is "\.ht"\.

~~~~~
This will be displayed as normal text.
But this will become a %%
  button .ht.button -text "button" -fg red
  .ht append .ht.button
%% which can invoke a Tcl command.
~~~~~

INDICES
=======

Some of the widget operations (__selection__, gotoline, __search__, etc\.) take
one or more indices as arguments\.  An index is a string used to
indicate a particular place within the text, such as the first and last
characters in a range to be selected\.  

An index must have one of the following forms:  

*line*\.*char*
:   Indicates *char*\'th character on line *line*\.  Both lines and
    characters are number from 0, so "0\.0" is the first
    beginning of the text\.  *Char* may be undesignated\.  In this
    case a character position of 0 is assumed\.

\@*x*,*y*
:   Indicates the character that covers the pixel whose x and y
    coordinates within the text\'s window are *x* and *y*\.

end
:   Indicates the end of the text\.

anchor
:   Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set
    with the __selection__ operation\.  

sel\.first
:   Indicates the first character in the selection\.  It is an
    error to use this form if the selection isn\'t in the entry
    window\.  

sel\.last
:   Indicates the character just after the last one in the      â”‚
    selection\.  It is an error to use this form if the
    selection isn\'t in the entry window\.  

VARIABLES
=========

The following global Tcl variables are maintained when an __htext__ file is
parsed\.  

htext(widget)
:   is the pathname of the __htext__ widget\.

htext(file)
:   is the name of the file the __htext__ widget is currently parsing\.
    It is the empty string when the __\-text__ option is used\.

htext(line)
:   is the current line number in the text\.

This information might be used to construct hyper links between
different files and/or lines\.  

SYNTAX
======

The __htext__ command creates a new Tcl command whose name is *pathName*\.
This command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget\.
It has the following general form: *pathName* *oper* ?*args*?  *Oper* and *args*
determine the exact behavior of the command\.  

OPERATIONS
==========

The following operations are available for __htext__ widgets:

*pathName* __append__ *window* ?*option* *value*?\.\.\.

:   Embeds the widget *window* into the htext widget\.  *Window* is the
    pathname of the widget to be embedded which must be a child of
    *pathName*\.  *Window* will be positioned in the htext widget at the
    current location of the text\. If *option* and *value* pairs are
    present, they configure various aspects how *window* appears in
    *pathName*\.  The following options are available\.

    \-anchor *anchorPos*
    :   Specifies how *window* will be arranged if there is any
        extra space in the cavity surrounding the window\.  For
        example, if *anchorPos* is __center__ then the window is
        centered in the cavity; if *anchorPos* is __w__ then the window
        will be drawn such it touches the leftmost edge of the
        cavity\. The default is center\.  

    \-fill *style*
    :   Specifies how the *window* should be stretched to occupy
        the extra space in the cavity surrounding it (if any
        exists)\.  *Style* is none, x, y, both\.  If *style* is x, the
        width of *window* is expanded to fill the cavity\.  If *style*
        is __y__, the height is expanded\.  The default is none\.

    \-height *pixels*
    :   Sets the height of the cavity surrounding *window*\.  If
        *pixels* is zero, the height of the cavity will be the same
        as the requested height of *window*\.  If *pixels* is less
        than the requested height of *window*, *window* will be
        reduced to fit the cavity\.  The default is 0\.

    \-ipadx *pad*
    :   Sets the amount of internal padding to be added to the
        width *window*\.  *Pad* can be a list of one or two numbers\.
        If *pad* has two elements, the left side of *window* is
        extended by the first value and the right side by the
        second value\.  If *pad* is just one value, both the left
        and right sides are padded by evenly by the value\.  The
        default is 0\.  

    \-ipady *pad*
    :   Sets an amount of internal padding to be added to the
        height of *window*\.  *Pad* can be a list of one or two
        numbers\.  If *pad* has two elements, the top of *window* is
        padded by the first value and the bottom by the second
        value\.  If *pad* is just one number, both the top and
        bottom are padded evenly by the value\.  The default is 0\.

    \-justify *justify*
    :   Justifies *window* vertically within the cavity containing
        it in relation to the line of text\. *Justify* is __top__,
        __bottom__, or  __center__\.  If *justify* is center the widget is
        centered along the baseline of the line of text\.  The
        default is center\.  

    \-padx *pad*
    :   Sets the padding on the left and right sides of *window*\.
        *Pad* can be a list of one or two numbers\.  If *pad* has two
        elements, the left side of *window* is padded by the first
        value and the right side by the second value\.  If *pad* has
        just one value, both the left and right sides are padded
        evenly by the value\.  The default is 0\.

    \-pady *pad*
    :   Sets the padding above and below *window*\.  *Pad* can be a
        list of one or two numbers\.  If *pad* has two elements, the
        area above *window* is padded by the first value and the
        area below by the second value\.  If *pad* is just one
        number, both the top and bottom are padded by the value\.
        The default is 0\.  

    \-relheight *value*
    :   Specifies the height of the cavity containing *window*
        relative to the height of *pathName*\.  *Value* is real number
        indicating the ratio of the height of the cavity to the
        height of *pathName*\.  As the height of *pathName* changes,
        so will the height of *window*\.  If *value* is 0\.0 or less,
        the height of the cavity is the requested height *window*\.
        The default is 0\.0\.  

    \-relwidth *value*
    :   Specifies the width of the cavity containing *window*
        relative to the width of *pathName*\.  *Value* is real number
        indicating the ratio of the width of the cavity to the
        width of IpathName\.  As the height of *pathName* changes,
        so will the height of *window*\.  If *value* is 0\.0 or less,
        the width of the cavity is the requested width of *window*\.
        The default is 0\.0\.  

    \-width *value*
    :   Species the width of the cavity containing the child
        window\.  *Value* must be in a form accepted by
        __Tk\_GetPixels__\.  If *value* is greater than zero, the cavity
        is resized to that width\.  If the requested window width
        is greater than the cavity\'s width, the window will be
        reduced to fit the cavity\.  By default, the cavity is
        requested width of the child window\.  

*pathName* __configure__ ?*window*? ?*option*? ?*value* *option* *value* *\.\.\.*?

:   Queries or modifies the configuration options of the text widget
    or one of its embedded widgets\.  If no *window* argument is
    present, the htext widget itself is configured\.  Otherwise
    *window* is the pathname of a widget already embedded into the
    htext widget\.  Then this command configure the options for the
    embedded widget\.  

If *option* isn\'t specified, a list describing all of the current options
for *pathName* or *window* is returned\.  If *option* is specified, but not
*value*, then a list describing the option *option* is returned\.  If one or
more *option* and *value* pairs are specified, then for each pair, the
htext or embedded window option *option* is set to *value*\.

The following options are valid for the htext widget\.

\-background *color*
:   Sets the background of the htext widget to *color*\.  This
    default is white\.  

\-cursor *cursor*
:   Specifies the cursor for the htext widget\.  The default
    cursor is pencil\.  

\-file *fileName*
:   Specifies a __htext__ file to be displayed in the window\.  If
    the value is the empty string, the __\-text__ option is used
    instead\.  See the section __FILE FORMAT__ for a description
    of the __htext__ file format\.  

\-font *fontName*
:   Sets the font of the text in the htext widget to
    *fontName*\. The default is \*\-Helvetica\-Bold\-R\-
    Normal\-\*\-12\-120\-\*\.  

\-foreground *color*
:   Sets the foreground of the htext widget to *color*\.  This
    is the color of the text\.  This default is black\.

\-height *pixels*
:   Specifies the height of the htext widget window\.

\-linespacing *pixels*
:   Specifies the spacing between each line of text\.  The
    value must be in a form accepted by __Tk\_GetPixels__\. The
    default value is 1 pixel\.  

\-specialchar *number*
:   Specifies the ASCII value of the special double character
    delimiters\.  In __htext__ files, the text between these
    special characters is evaluated as a block of Tcl
    commands\. The default special character is the 0x25
    (percent sign)\.  

\-text *text*
:   Specifies the text to be displayed in the htext widget\.
    *Text* can be any valid string of characters\. See __FILE__
    __FORMAT__ for a description\.  

\-xscrollcommand *string*
:   Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate
    with horizontal scrollbars\.  When the view in the htext
    widget\'s window changes (or whenever anything else occurs
    that could change the display in a scrollbar, such as a
    change in the total size of the widget\'s contents), the
    widget invoke *string* concatenated by two numbers\.  Each
    of the numbers is a fraction between 0 and 1, which
    indicates a position in the document\.  If this option is
    not specified, then no command will be executed\.

\-yscrollcommand *string*
:   Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate
    with vertical scrollbars\.  When the view in the htext
    widget\'s window changes (or whenever anything else occurs
    that could change the display in a scrollbar, such as a
    change in the total size of the widget\'s contents), the
    widget invoke *string* concatenated by two numbers\.  Each
    of the numbers is a fraction between 0 and 1, which
    indicates a position in the document\.  If this option is
    not specified, then no command will be executed\.

\-width *pixels*
:   Specifies the desired width of the viewport window\.  If
    the *pixels* is less than one, the window will grow to
    accommodate the widest line of text\.  

\-xscrollunits *pixels*
:   Specifies the horizontal scrolling distance\. The default
    is 10 pixels\.  

\-yscrollunits *pixels*
:   Specifies the vertical scrolling distance\. The default is
    10 pixels\.  

*pathName* __gotoline__ ?*index*?

:   Sets the top line of the text to *index*\. *Index* must be a valid
    text index (the character offset is ignored)\.  If an *index* isn\'t
    provided, the current line number is returned\.

*pathName* __scan mark__ *position*

:   Records *position* and the current view in the text window;  used
    in conjunction with later __scan dragto__ commands\.  *Position* must
    be in the form "*\@x,y*, where *x* and *y* are window coordinates\.
    Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press
    in the widget\.  It returns an empty string\.  

*pathName* __scan dragto__ *position*

:   Computes the difference between *position* and the position
    registered in the last __scan mark__ command for the widget\.  The
    view is then adjusted up or down by 10 times the difference in
    coordinates\.  This command is can be associated with mouse
    motion events to produce the effect of dragging the text at high
    speed through the window\.  *Position* must be in the form "*\@x,y*,
    where *x* and *y* are window coordinates\. The command returns an
    empty string\.  

*pathName* __search__ *pattern* ?*from*? ?*to*?

:   Returns the number of the next line matching *pattern*\.  *Pattern*
    is a string which obeys the matching rules of __Tcl\_StringMatch__\.
    *From* and *to* are text line numbers (inclusive) which bound the
    search\.  If no match for *pattern* can be found, __\-1__ is returned\.

*pathName* __xview__ ?*position*?

:   Moves the viewport horizontally to the new text x\-coordinate
    position\.  *Position* is the offset from the left side of the text
    to the current position and must be in a form accepted by
    __Tk\_GetPixels__\. If *position* is not present, the current text
    position is returned\.  

*pathName* __yview__ ?*position*?

:   Moves the viewport vertically to the new text y\-coordinate
    position\.  *Position* is the offset from the top of the text to
    the current position and must be in a form accepted by
    __Tk\_GetPixels__\. If *position* is not present, the current text
    position is returned\.
