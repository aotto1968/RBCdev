htext \- Create and manipulate hypertext widgets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]htext\f[] \f[I]pathName\f[] ?\f[I]option\f[] \f[I]value\f[]?...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]htext\f[] command creates a new window (given by the
\f[I]pathName\f[] argument) and makes it into a \f[B]htext\f[] widget.
Additional options, described above, may be specified on the command
line or in the option database to configure aspects of the widget such
as its color and font.
At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
\f[I]pathName\f[], but \f[I]pathName\f[]\[aq]s parent must exist.
The \f[B]htext\f[] command returns its \f[I]pathName\f[].
.PP
The \f[B]htext\f[] widget is hybrid of a non\-editable text widget and a
geometry manager (e.g.
the packer).
It displays text (optionally read from file) in a window.
Text can be scrolled either horizontally or vertically using the
\f[B]htext\f[] window as a viewport.
In addition, Tcl commands can be embedded into the text which are
evaluated as the text is parsed.
Text between special double characters (percent signs "%%") is
immediately passed to the Tcl interpreter for evaluation.
.PP
Furthermore, any widget or widget hierarchy can be packed in\-line and
made to appear on the current line of the text.
Widgets are packed using the \f[B]htext append\f[] command.
All widgets must be children of the \f[B]htext\f[] window and must
already exist before packing.
Once a widget has been packed it cannot be moved to a different position
within the text.
Widgets can be resized but they will remain at the same position within
the text.
.PP
Before a file or text string is parsed by the \f[B]htext\f[] widget, all
the widget\[aq]s current children are destroyed.
You can reload files or text without worrying about unmapping or
destroying each child window beforehand.
.PP
Setting the either the \f[B]\-file\f[] or \f[B]\-text\f[] configuration
option will adjust the value of the other.
If both options are set, the file takes precedence.
When a new file is read using the \f[B]\-file\f[] option, the value of
the \f[B]\-text\f[] option is reset to the empty string.
Likewise, when the \f[B]\-text\f[] option is set, the string
representing the \f[B]\-file\f[] option is cleared.
.SH FILE FORMAT
.PP
The format of \f[B]htext\f[] text file is typically ASCII text.
Text enclosed by special double characters (by default, percent signs
\[aq]%%\[aq]) is interpreted and executed as Tcl commands.
The special character may be specified by the \f[B]\-specialchar\f[]
option.
In the following example of a \f[B]htext\f[] file, a button widget is
appended to the text between the words "a" and "which".
The \f[I]pathName\f[] of the \f[B]htext\f[] widget is ".ht".
.IP

.SH INDICES
.PP
Some of the widget operations (\f[B]selection\f[], gotoline,
\f[B]search\f[], etc.) take one or more indices as arguments.
An index is a string used to indicate a particular place within the
text, such as the first and last characters in a range to be selected.
.PP
An index must have one of the following forms:
.TP
.B \f[I]line\f[].\f[I]char\f[]
Indicates \f[I]char\f[]\[aq]th character on line \f[I]line\f[].
Both lines and characters are number from 0, so "0.0" is the first
beginning of the text.
\f[I]Char\f[] may be undesignated.
In this case a character position of 0 is assumed.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \@\f[I]x\f[],\f[I]y\f[]
Indicates the character that covers the pixel whose x and y coordinates
within the text\[aq]s window are \f[I]x\f[] and \f[I]y\f[].
.RS

.B anchor

.SH SYNTAX
.PP
The \f[B]htext\f[] command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
\f[I]pathName\f[].
This command may be used to invoke various operations on the widget.
It has the following general form: \f[I]pathName\f[] \f[I]oper\f[]
?\f[I]args\f[]?
\f[I]Oper\f[] and \f[I]args\f[] determine the exact behavior of the
command.
.SH OPERATIONS
.PP
The following operations are available for \f[B]htext\f[] widgets:
.TP
.B \f[I]pathName\f[] \f[B]append\f[] \f[I]window\f[] ?\f[I]option\f[] \f[I]value\f[]?...
Embeds the widget \f[I]window\f[] into the htext widget.
\f[I]Window\f[] is the pathname of the widget to be embedded which must
be a child of \f[I]pathName\f[].
\f[I]Window\f[] will be positioned in the htext widget at the current
location of the text.
If \f[I]option\f[] and \f[I]value\f[] pairs are present, they configure
various aspects how \f[I]window\f[] appears in \f[I]pathName\f[].
The following options are available.
.RS
.TP
.B \-anchor \f[I]anchorPos\f[]
Specifies how \f[I]window\f[] will be arranged if there is any extra
space in the cavity surrounding the window.
For example, if \f[I]anchorPos\f[] is \f[B]center\f[] then the window is
centered in the cavity; if \f[I]anchorPos\f[] is \f[B]w\f[] then the
window will be drawn such it touches the leftmost edge of the cavity.
The default is center.
.RS
.RE
