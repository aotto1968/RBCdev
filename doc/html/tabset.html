<p>tabset - Create and manipulate tabset widgets</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>tabset</strong> <em>pathName</em> ?<em>options</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>tabset</strong> widget displays a series of overlapping folders. Only the contents of one folder at a time is displayed. By clicking on the tab's of a folder, you can view other folders. Each folder may contain any Tk widget that can be automatically positioned and resized in the folder.</p>
<p>There's no limit to the number of folders. Tabs can be tiered or scrolled. Pages (i.e. embedded widgets) can be torn off and displayed in another toplevel widget, and also restored. A tabset can also be used as just a set of tabs, without a displaying any pages. You can bind events to individual tabs, so it's easy to add features like &quot;balloon help&quot;.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>Notebooks are a popular graphical paradigm. They allow you to organize several windows that are too big to display at the same time as pages of a notebook. For example, your application may display several X-Y graphs at the same time. The graphs are too big to pack into the same frame. Managing them in several <strong>toplevel</strong> widgets is also cumbersome and clutters the screen. Instead, the <strong>tabset</strong> widget organizes the graphs as folders in a notebook.</p>
<p>Only one page is visible at a time. When you click on a tab, the folder corresponding to the tab is displayed in the <strong>tabset</strong> widget. The tabset also lets you temporarily tear pages out of the notebook into a separate toplevel widget, and put them back in the tabset later. For example, you could compare two graphs side-by-side by tearing them out, and then replace them when you are finished.</p>
<p>A tabset can contain any number of folders. If there are too many tabs to view, you can arrange them as multiple tiers or scroll the tabs. You can also attach Tk scrollbars to the tabset to scroll the tabs.</p>
<h1 id="syntax">SYNTAX</h1>
<p>The <strong>tabset</strong> command creates a new window using the <em>pathName</em> argument and makes it into a tabset widget. <strong>tabset</strong> <em>pathName</em> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?... Additional options may be specified on the command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the tabset such as its colors, font, text, and relief. The <strong>tabset</strong> command returns its <em>pathName</em> argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named <em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p>When first created, a new tabset contains no tabs. Tabs are added or deleted using widget operations described below. It is not necessary for all the tabs to be displayed in the tabset window at once; commands described below may be used to change the view in the window. Tabsets allow scrolling of tabs using the <strong>-scrollcommand</strong> option. They also support scanning (see the <strong>scan</strong> operation). Tabs may be arranged along any side of the tabset window using the <strong>-side</strong> option.</p>
<p>The size of the tabset window is determined the number of tiers of tabs and the sizes of the Tk widgets embedded inside each folder. The widest widget determines the width of the folder. The tallest determines the height. If no folders contain an embedded widget, the size is detemined solely by the size of the tabs.</p>
<p>You can override either dimension with the tabset's <strong>-width</strong> and <strong>-height</strong> options.</p>
<h1 id="indices">INDICES</h1>
<p>Indices refer to individual tabs/folders in the tabset. Many of the operations for tabset widgets take one or more indices as arguments. An index may take several forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>number</em></dt>
<dd>Unique node id of the tab.
</dd>
<dt>@<em>x</em>,<em>y</em></dt>
<dd>Tab that covers the point in the tabset window specified by <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> (in screen coordinates). If no tab covers that point, then the index is ignored.
</dd>
<dt>select</dt>
<dd>The currently selected tab. The <strong>select</strong> index is typically changed by either clicking on the tab with the left mouse button or using the widget's <strong>invoke</strong> operation.
</dd>
<dt>active</dt>
<dd>The tab where the mouse pointer is currently located. The label is drawn using its active colors (see the <strong>-activebackground</strong> and <strong>-activeforeground</strong> options). The <strong>active</strong> index is typically changed by moving the mouse pointer over a tab or using the widget's <strong>activate</strong> operation. There can be only one active tab at a time. If there is no tab located under the mouse pointer, the index is ignored.
</dd>
<dt>focus</dt>
<dd>Tab that currently has the widget's focus. This tab is displayed with a dashed line around its label. You can change this using the <strong>focus</strong> operation. If no tab has focus, then the index is ignored.
</dd>
<dt>down</dt>
<dd>Tab immediately below the tab that currently has focus, if there is one. If there is no tab below, the current tab is returned.
</dd>
<dt>left</dt>
<dd>Tab immediately to the left the tab that currently has focus, if there is one. If there is no tab to the left, the current tab is returned.
</dd>
<dt>right</dt>
<dd>Tab immediately to the right the tab that currently has focus, if there is one. If there is no tab to the right, the current tab is returned.
</dd>
<dt>up</dt>
<dd>Tab immediately above, if there is one, to the tab that currently has focus. If there is no tab above, the current tab is returned.
</dd>
<dt>end</dt>
<dd>Last tab in the tabset. If there are no tabs in the tabset then the index is ignored.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Some indices may not always be available. For example, if the mouse is not over any tab, &quot;active&quot; does not have an index. For most tabset operations this is harmless and ignored.</p>
<h1 id="operations">OPERATIONS</h1>
<p>All <strong>tabset</strong> operations are invoked by specifying the widget's pathname, the operation, and any arguments that pertain to that operation. The general form is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>pathName</em> <em>operation</em> ?<em>arg</em> <em>arg</em> <em>...</em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Operation</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of the command. The following operations are available for tabset widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>activate</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd><p>Sets the active tab to the one indicated by <em>index</em>. The active tab is drawn with its <em>active</em> colors (see the <strong>-activebackground</strong> and <strong>-activeforeground</strong> options) and may be retrieved with the index <strong>active</strong>. Only one tab may be active at a time. If <em>index</em> is the empty string, then all tabs will be drawn with their normal foreground and background colors.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>bind</strong> <em>tagName</em> ?<em>sequence</em>? ?<em>command</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Associates <em>command</em> with <em>tagName</em> such that whenever the event sequence given by <em>sequence</em> occurs for a tab with this tag, <em>command</em> will be invoked. The syntax is similar to the <strong>bind</strong> command except that it operates on tabs, rather than widgets. See the <strong>bind</strong> manual entry for complete details on <em>sequence</em> and the substitutions performed on <em>command</em>.</p>
<p>If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing binding for the same <em>sequence</em> and <em>tagName</em>. If the first character of <em>command</em> is + then <em>command</em> augments an existing binding rather than replacing it. If no <em>command</em> argument is provided then the command currently associated with <em>tagName</em> and <em>sequence</em> (it's an error occurs if there's no such binding) is returned. If both <em>command</em> and <em>sequence</em> are missing then a list of all the event sequences for which bindings have been defined for <em>tagName</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the <strong>configure</strong> operation described in the section <strong>WIDGET OPTIONS</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>value</em> <em>option</em> <em>value</em> <em>...</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all the available options for <em>pathName</em> (see <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty string. <em>Option</em> and <em>value</em> are described in the section <strong>WIDGET OPTIONS</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>delete</strong> <em>first</em> ?<em>last</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Deletes one or more tabs from the tabset. <em>First</em> and <em>last</em> are the first and last indices, defining a range of tabs to be deleted. If <em>last</em> isn't specified, then only the tab at <em>first</em> is deleted.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>focus</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd><p>Designates a tab to get the widget's focus. This tab is displayed with a dashed line around its label.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>get</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the name of the tab. The value of <em>index</em> may be in any form described in the section <strong>INDICES .</strong></p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>index</strong> ?<em>flag</em>? <em>string</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the node id of the tab specified by <em>string</em>. If <em>flag</em> is <strong>-name</strong>, then <em>string</em> is the name of a tab. If <em>flag</em> is <strong>-index</strong>, <em>string</em> is an index such as &quot;active&quot; or &quot;focus&quot;. If <em>flag</em> isn't specified, it defaults to <strong>-index</strong>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>insert</strong> <em>position</em> <em>name</em> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?...</dt>
<dd><p>Inserts new tabs into the tabset. Tabs are inserted just before the tab given by <em>position</em>. <em>Position</em> may be either a number, indicating where in the list the new tab should be added, or <strong>end</strong>, indicating that the new tab is to be added the end of the list. <em>Name</em> is the symbolic name of the tab. <em>Be</em> <em>careful</em> <em>not</em> <em>to</em> <em>use</em> <em>a</em> <em>number.</em> <em>Otherwise</em> <em>the</em> <em>tabset</em> <em>will</em> <em>confuse</em> <em>it</em> <em>with</em> <em>tab</em> <em>indices</em>. Returns a list of indices for all the new tabs.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>invoke</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd><p>Selects the tab given by <em>index</em>, maps the tab's embedded widget, and invokes the Tcl command associated with the tab, if there is one. The return value is the return value from the Tcl command, or an empty string if there is no command associated with the tab. This command is ignored if the tab's state (see the <strong>-state</strong> option) is disabled.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>move</strong> <em>index</em> <strong>before</strong>|<strong>after</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd><p>Moves the tab <em>index</em> to a new position in the tabset.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>nearest</strong> <em>x</em> <em>y</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the name of the tab nearest to given X-Y screen coordinate.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>perforation</strong> <em>operation</em> ?<em>args</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>This operation controls the perforation on the tab label.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>perforation highlight</strong> <em>index</em> <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd><p>…</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>perforation invoke</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd><p>Invokes the command specified for perforations (see the <strong>-perforationcommand</strong> widget option). Typically this command places the page into a top level widget. The name of the toplevel is the concatonation of the <em>pathName</em>, &quot;-&quot;, and the <em>tabName</em>. The return value is the return value from the Tcl command, or an empty string if there is no command associated with the tab. This command is ignored if the tab's state (see the <strong>-state</strong> option) is disabled.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>scan</strong> <em>option</em> <em>args</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command implements scanning on tabsets. It has two forms, depending on <em>option</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>scan mark</strong> <em>x</em> <em>y</em></dt>
<dd><p>Records <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> and the current view in the tabset window; used with later <strong>scan dragto</strong> commands. Typically this command is associated with a mouse button press in the widget. It returns an empty string.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>scan dragto</strong> <em>x</em> <em>y</em>.</dt>
<dd><p>This command computes the difference between its <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> arguments and the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> arguments to the last <strong>scan mark</strong> command for the widget. It then adjusts the view by 10 times the difference in coordinates. This command is typically associated with mouse motion events in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the list at high speed through the window. The return value is an empty string.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>see</strong> <em>index</em></dt>
<dd><p>Scrolls the tabset so that the tab <em>index</em> is visible in the widget's window.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>size</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the number of tabs in the tabset.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>tab</strong> <em>operation</em> ?<em>args</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>…</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>tab cget</strong> <em>nameOrIndex</em> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the <strong>tab configure</strong> operation described in the section <strong>TAB OPTIONS</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>tab configure</strong> <em>nameOrIndex</em> ?<em>nameOrIndex</em>...? <em>option</em>? ?<em>value</em> <em>option</em> <em>value</em> <em>...</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Query or modify the configuration options of one or more tabs. If no <em>option</em> is specified, this operation returns a list describing all the available options for <em>nameOrIndex</em>. <em>NameOrIndex</em> can be either the name of a tab or its index. Names of tabs take precedence over their indices. That means a tab named <em>focus</em> is picked over the &quot;focus&quot; tab.</p>
<p>If <em>option</em> is specified, but not <em>value</em>, then a list describing the one named option is returned. If one or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then each named tab (specified by <em>nameOrIndex</em>) will have its configurations option(s) set the given value(s). In this last case, the empty string is returned. <em>Option</em> and <em>value</em> are described in the section <strong>TAB OPTIONS</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>tab names</strong> ?<em>pattern</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Returns the names of all the tabs matching the given pattern. If no <em>pattern</em> argument is provided, then all tab names are returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>tab tearoff</strong> <em>index</em> ?<em>newName</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Reparents the widget embedded into <em>index</em>, placing it inside of <em>newName</em>. <em>NewName</em> is either the name of an new widget that will contain the embedded widget or the name of the <strong>tabset</strong> widget. It the last case, the embedded widget is put back into the folder.</p>
<p>If no <em>newName</em> argument is provided, then the name of the current parent of the embedded widget is returned.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>view</strong> <em>args</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command queries or changes the position of the tabset in the widget's window. It can take any of the following forms:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>view</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Returns a list of two numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 that describe the amount and position of the tabset that is visible in the window. For example, if <em>view</em> is &quot;0.2 0.6&quot;, 20% of the tabset's text is off-screen to the left, 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the tabset is off-screen to the right. These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the <strong>-scrollcommand</strong> option.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>view moveto</strong> <em>fraction</em></dt>
<dd><p>Adjusts the view in the window so that <em>fraction</em> of the total width of the tabset text is off-screen to the left. <em>fraction</em> must be a number between 0.0 and 1.0.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>view scroll</strong> <em>number</em> <em>what</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command shifts the view in the window (left/top or right/bottom) according to <em>number</em> and <em>what</em>. <em>Number</em> must be an integer. <em>What</em> must be either <strong>units</strong> or <strong>pages</strong> or an abbreviation of these. If <em>what</em> is <strong>units</strong>, the view adjusts left or right by <em>number</em> scroll units (see the <strong>-scrollincrement</strong> option). ; if it is <strong>pages</strong> then the view adjusts by <em>number</em> widget windows. If <em>number</em> is negative then tabs farther to the left become visible; if it is positive then tabs farther to the right become visible.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<dd>Specifies the maximum number of tiers to use to display the tabs. The default value is 1.
</dd>
<dt>-tile <em>image</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies a tiled background for the widget. If <em>image</em> isn't &quot;&quot;, the background is tiled using <em>image</em>. Otherwise, the normal background color is drawn (see the <strong>-background</strong> option). <em>Image</em> must be an image created using the Tk <strong>image</strong> command. The default is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>-width <em>pixels</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the requested width of the widget. If <em>pixels</em> is 0, then the width of the widget will be calculated based on the size the tabs and their pages. The default is 0.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="tab-options">TAB OPTIONS</h1>
<p>In addition to the <strong>configure</strong> operation, widget configuration options may also be set by the Tk <strong>option</strong> command. The class resource name is Tab.</p>
<pre><code>option add *Tabset.Tab.Foreground white
option add *Tabset.name.Background blue</code></pre>
<p>The following widget options are available:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-activebackground <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the active background color for <em>nameOrIndex</em>. A tab is active when the mouse is positioned over it or set by the <strong>activate</strong> operation. This overrides the widget's <strong>-activebackground</strong> option.
</dd>
<dt>-activeforeground <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the default active foreground color <em>nameOrIndex</em>. A tab is &quot;active&quot; when the mouse is positioned over it or set by the <strong>activate</strong> operation. Individual tabs may override this option by setting the tab's <strong>-activeforeground</strong> option.
</dd>
<dt>-anchor <em>anchor</em></dt>
<dd>Anchors the tab's embedded widget to a particular edge of the folder. This option has effect only if the space in the folder surrounding the embedded widget is larger than the widget itself. <em>Anchor</em> specifies how the widget will be positioned in the extra space. For example, if <em>anchor</em> is center then the window is centered in the folder ; if <em>anchor</em> is w then the window will be aligned with the leftmost edge of the folder. The default value is center.
</dd>
<dt>-background <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the background color for <em>nameOrIndex</em>. Setting this option overides the widget's <strong>-tabbackground</strong> option.
</dd>
<dt>-bindtags <em>tagList</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the binding tags for this tab. <em>TagList</em> is a list of binding tag names. The tags and their order will determine how commands for events in tabs are invoked. Each tag in the list matching the event sequence will have its Tcl command executed. Implicitly the name of the tab is always the first tag in the list. The default value is all.
</dd>
<dt>-command <em>string</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies a Tcl script to be associated with <em>nameOrIndex</em>. This command is typically invoked when left mouse button is released over the tab. Setting this option overrides the widget's <strong>-selectcommand</strong> option.
</dd>
<dt>-data <em>string</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies a string to be associated with <em>nameOrIndex</em>. This value isn't used in the widget code. It may be used in Tcl bindings to associate extra data (other than the image or text) with the tab. The default value is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>-fill <em>fill</em></dt>
<dd>If the space in the folder surrounding the tab's embedded widget is larger than the widget, then <em>fill</em> indicates if the embedded widget should be stretched to occupy the extra space. <em>Fill</em> is either none, x, y, both. For example, if <em>fill</em> is x, then the widget is stretched horizontally. If <em>fill</em> is y, the widget is stretched vertically. The default is none.
</dd>
<dt>-font <em>fontName</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the font for the text in tab labels. If <em>fontName</em> is not the empty string, this overrides the tabset's <strong>-font</strong> option. The default value is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>-foreground <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the color of the label for <em>nameOrIndex</em>. If <em>color</em> is not the empty string, this overrides the widget's <strong>-tabforeground</strong> option. The default value is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>-image <em>imageName</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the image to be drawn in label for <em>nameOrIndex</em>. If <em>image</em> is &quot;&quot;, no image will be drawn. Both text and images may be displayed at the same time in tab labels. The default value is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>-ipadx <em>pad</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the padding to the left and right of the label. <em>Pad</em> can be a list of one or two screen distances. If <em>pad</em> has two elements, the left side of the label is padded by the first distance and the right side by the second. If <em>pad</em> has just one distance, both the left and right sides are padded evenly. The default value is 0.
</dd>
<dt>-ipady <em>pad</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the padding to the top and bottom of the label. <em>Pad</em> can be a list of one or two screen distances. If <em>pad</em> has two elements, the top of the label is padded by the first distance and the bottom by the second. If <em>pad</em> has just one distance, both the top and bottom sides are padded evenly. The default value is 0.
</dd>
<dt>-padx <em>pad</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the padding around the left and right of the embedded widget, if one exists. <em>Pad</em> can be a list of one or two screen distances. If <em>pad</em> has two elements, the left side of the widget is padded by the first distance and the right side by the second. If <em>pad</em> has just one distance, both the left and right sides are padded evenly. The default value is 0.
</dd>
<dt>-pady <em>pad</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the padding around the top and bottom of the embedded widget, if one exists. <em>Pad</em> can be a list of one or two screen distances. If <em>pad</em> has two elements, the top of the widget is padded by the first distance and the bottom by the second. If <em>pad</em> has just one distance, both the top and bottom sides are padded evenly. The default value is 0.
</dd>
<dt>-selectbackground <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the color to use when displaying background of the selected tab. If <em>color</em> is not the empty string, this overrides the widget's <strong>-selectbackground</strong> option. The default value is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>-shadow <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the shadow color for the text in the tab's label. Drop shadows are useful when both the foreground and background of the tab have similar color intensities. If <em>color</em> is the empty string, no shadow is drawn. The default value is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>-state <em>state</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the state of the tab. If <em>state</em> is disable the text of the tab is drawn as engraved and operations on the tab (such as <strong>invoke</strong> and <strong>tab tearoff</strong>) are ignored. The default is normal.
</dd>
<dt>-stipple <em>bitmap</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies a stipple pattern to use for the background of the folder when the window is torn off. <em>Bitmap</em> specifies a bitmap to use as the stipple pattern. The default is RBC.
</dd>
<dt>-text <em>text</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the text of the tab's label. The exact way the text is drawn may be affected by other options such as <strong>-state</strong> or <strong>-rotate</strong>.
</dd>
<dt>-window <em>pathName</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the widget to be embedded into the tab. <em>PathName</em> must be a child of the <strong>tabset</strong> widget. The tabset will &quot;pack&quot; and manage the size and placement of <em>pathName</em>. The default value is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>-windowheight <em>pixels</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the requested height of the page. The page is the area under the tab used to display the page contents. If <em>pixels</em> is 0, the maximum height of all embedded tab windows is used. The default is 0.
</dd>
<dt>-windowwidth <em>pixels</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the requested width of the page. The page is the area under the tab used to display the page contents. If <em>pixels</em> is 0, the maximum width of all embedded tab windows is used. The default is 0.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="default-bindings">DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>RBC automatically generates class bindings that supply tabsets their default behaviors. The following event sequences are set by default for tabsets (via the class bind tag Tabset):</p>
<p><strong>&lt;ButtonPress-2&gt;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&lt;B2-Motion&gt;</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>&lt;ButtonRelease-2&gt;</dt>
<dd>Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning. If it is pressed and dragged over the tabset, the contents of the tabset drag at high speed in the direction the mouse moves.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>&lt;KeyPress-Up&gt;</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>&lt;KeyPress-Down&gt;</dt>
<dd>The up and down arrow keys move the focus to the tab immediately above or below the current focus tab. The tab with focus is drawn with the a dashed outline around the tab label.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>&lt;KeyPress-Left&gt;</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>&lt;KeyPress-Right&gt;</dt>
<dd>The left and right arrow keys move the focus to the tab immediately to the left or right of the current focus tab. The tab with focus is drawn with the a dashed outline around the tab label.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>&lt;KeyPress-space&gt;</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>&lt;KeyPress-Return&gt;</dt>
<dd>The space and return keys select the current tab given focus. When a folder is selected, it's command is invoked and the embedded widget is mapped.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each tab, by default, also has a set of bindings (via the tag all). These bindings may be reset using the tabset's <strong>bind</strong> operation.</p>
<p><strong>&lt;Enter&gt;</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>&lt;Leave&gt;</dt>
<dd>When the mouse pointer enters a tab, it is activated (i.e. drawn in its active colors) and when the pointer leaves, it is redrawn in its normal colors.
</dd>
<dt>&lt;ButtonRelease-1&gt;</dt>
<dd>Clicking with the left mouse button on a tab causes the tab to be selected and its Tcl script (see the <strong>-command</strong> or <strong>-selectcommand</strong> options) to be invoked. The folder and any embedded widget (if one is specified) is automatically mapped.
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>&lt;ButtonRelease-3&gt;</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>&lt;Control-ButtonRelease-1&gt;</dt>
<dd>Clicking on the right mouse button (or the left mouse button with the Control key held down) tears off the current page into its own toplevel widget. The embedded widget is re-packed into a new toplevel and an outline of the widget is drawn in the folder. Clicking again (toggling) will reverse this operation and replace the page back in the folder.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="bind-tags">BIND TAGS</h1>
<p>You can bind commands to tabs that are triggered when a particular event sequence occurs in them, much like canvas items in Tk's canvas widget. Not all event sequences are valid. The only binding events that may be specified are those related to the mouse and keyboard (such as <strong>Enter</strong>, <strong>Leave</strong>, <strong>ButtonPress</strong>, <strong>Motion</strong>, and <strong>KeyPress</strong>).</p>
<p>It is possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event. This could occur, for example, if one binding is associated with the tab name and another is associated with the tab's tags (see the <strong>-bindtags</strong> option). When this occurs, all the matching bindings are invoked. A binding associated with the tab name is invoked first, followed by one binding for each of the tab's bindtags. If there are multiple matching bindings for a single tag, then only the most specific binding is invoked. A continue command in a binding script terminates that script, and a break command terminates that script and skips any remaining scripts for the event, just as for the bind command.</p>
<p>The <strong>-bindtags</strong> option for tabs controls addition tag names that can be matched. Implicitly the first tag for each tab is its name. Setting the value of the <strong>-bindtags</strong> option doesn't change this.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>You create a tabset widget with the <strong>tabset</strong> command.</p>
<pre><code># Create a new tabset
tabset .ts -relief sunken -borderwidth 2</code></pre>
<p>A new Tcl command .ts is also created. This command can be used to query and modify the tabset. For example, to change the default font used by all the tab labels, you use the new command and the tabset's <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code># Change the default font.
.ts configure -font &quot;fixed&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can then add folders using the <strong>insert</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code># Create a new folder &quot;f1&quot;
.ts insert 0 &quot;f1&quot;</code></pre>
<p>This inserts the new tab named &quot;f1&quot; into the tabset. The index 0 indicates location to insert the new tab. You can also use the index end to append a tab to the end of the tabset. By default, the text of the tab is the name of the tab. You can change this by configuring the <strong>-text</strong> option.</p>
<pre><code># Change the label of &quot;f1&quot;
.ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -text &quot;Tab #1&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>insert</strong> operation lets you add one or more folders at a time.</p>
<pre><code>.ts insert end &quot;f2&quot; -text &quot;Tab #2&quot; &quot;f3&quot; &quot;f4&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The tab on each folder contains a label. A label may display both an image and a text string. You can reconfigure the tab's attributes (foreground/background colors, font, rotation, etc) using the <strong>tab</strong> <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code># Add an image to the label of &quot;f1&quot;
set image [image create photo -file stopsign.gif]
.ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -image $image
.ts tab configure &quot;f2&quot; -rotate 90</code></pre>
<p>Each folder may contain an embedded widget to represent its contents. The widget to be embedded must be a child of the tabset widget. Using the <strong>-window</strong> option, you specify the name of widget to be embedded. But don't pack the widget, the tabset takes care of placing and arranging the widget for you.</p>
<pre><code>graph .ts.graph
.ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -window &quot;.ts.graph&quot; \
    -fill both -padx 0.25i -pady 0.25i</code></pre>
<p>The size of the folder is determined the sizes of the Tk widgets embedded inside each folder. The folder will be as wide as the widest widget in any folder. The tallest determines the height. You can use the tab's <strong>-pagewidth</strong> and <strong>-pageheight</strong> options override this.</p>
<p>Other options control how the widget appears in the folder. The <strong>-fill</strong> option says that you wish to have the widget stretch to fill the available space in the folder.</p>
<pre><code>.ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -fill both -padx 0.25i -pady 0.25i</code></pre>
<p>Now when you click the left mouse button on &quot;f1&quot;, the graph will be displayed in the folder. It will be automatically hidden when another folder is selected. If you click on the right mouse button, the embedded widget will be moved into a toplevel widget of its own. Clicking again on the right mouse button puts it back into the folder.</p>
<p>If you want to share a page between two different folders, the <strong>-command</strong> option lets you specify a Tcl command to be invoked whenever the folder is selected. You can reset the <strong>-window</strong> option for the tab whenever it's clicked.</p>
<pre><code>.ts tab configure &quot;f2&quot; -command {
    .ts tab configure &quot;f2&quot; -window &quot;.ts.graph&quot;
}
.ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -command {
    .ts tab configure &quot;f1&quot; -window &quot;.ts.graph&quot;
}</code></pre>
<p>If you have many folders, you may wish to stack tabs in multiple tiers. The tabset's <strong>-tiers</strong> option requests a maximum number of tiers. The default is one tier.</p>
<pre><code>.ts configure -tiers 2</code></pre>
<p>If the tabs can fit in less tiers, the widget will use that many. Whenever there are more tabs than can be displayed in the maximum number of tiers, the tabset will automatically let you scroll the tabs. You can even attach a scrollbar to the tabset.</p>
<pre><code>.ts configure -scrollcommand { .sbar set }  -scrollincrement 20
.sbar configure -orient horizontal -command { .ts view }</code></pre>
<p>By default tabs are along the top of the tabset from left to right. But tabs can be placed on any side of the tabset using the <strong>-side</strong> option.</p>
<pre><code># Arrange tabs along the right side of the tabset.
.ts configure -side right -rotate 270</code></pre>
