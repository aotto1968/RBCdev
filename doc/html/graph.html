<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>graph - 2D graph for plotting X-Y coordinate data.</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>graph</strong> <em>pathName</em> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?...</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>graph</strong> command creates a graph for plotting two-dimensional data (X-Y coordinates). It has many configurable components: coordinate axes, elements, legend, grid lines, cross hairs, etc. They allow you to customize the look and feel of the graph.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>graph</strong> command creates a new window for plotting two-dimensional data (X-Y coordinates). Data points are plotted in a rectangular area displayed in the center of the new window. This is the <em>plotting</em> <em>area</em>. The coordinate axes are drawn in the margins around the plotting area. By default, the legend is displayed in the right margin. The title is displayed in top margin.</p>
<p>The <strong>graph</strong> widget is composed of several components: coordinate axes, data elements, legend, grid, cross hairs, pens, postscript, and annotation markers.</p>
<dl>
<dt>axis</dt>
<dd>The graph has four standard axes (x, x2, y, and y2), but you can create and display any number of axes. Axes control what region of data is displayed and how the data is scaled. Each axis consists of the axis line, title, major and minor ticks, and tick labels. Tick labels display the value at each major tick.
</dd>
<dt>crosshairs</dt>
<dd>Cross hairs are used to position the mouse pointer relative to the X and Y coordinate axes. Two perpendicular lines, intersecting at the current location of the mouse, extend across the plotting area to the coordinate axes.
</dd>
<dt>element</dt>
<dd>An element represents a set of data points. Elements can be plotted with a symbol at each data point and lines connecting the points. The appearance of the element, such as its symbol, line width, and color is configurable.
</dd>
<dt>grid</dt>
<dd>Extends the major and minor ticks of the X-axis and/or Y-axis across the plotting area.
</dd>
<dt>legend</dt>
<dd>The legend displays the name and symbol of each data element. The legend can be drawn in any margin or in the plotting area.
</dd>
<dt>marker</dt>
<dd>Markers are used annotate or highlight areas of the graph. For example, you could use a polygon marker to fill an area under a curve, or a text marker to label a particular data point. Markers come in various forms: text strings, bitmaps, connected line segments, images, polygons, or embedded widgets.
</dd>
<dt>pen</dt>
<dd>Pens define attributes (both symbol and line style) for elements. Data elements use pens to specify how they should be drawn. A data element may use many pens at once. Here, the particular pen used for a data point is determined from each element's weight vector (see the element's <strong>-weight</strong> and <strong>-style</strong> options).
</dd>
<dt>postscript</dt>
<dd>The widget can generate encapsulated PostScript output. This component has several options to configure how the PostScript is generated.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="syntax">SYNTAX</h1>
<p><strong>graph</strong> <em>pathName</em> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?... The <strong>graph</strong> command creates a new window <em>pathName</em> and makes it into a <strong>graph</strong> widget. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named <em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>'s parent must exist. Additional options may be specified on the command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the graph such as its colors and font. See the <strong>configure</strong> operation below for the exact details about what <em>option</em> and <em>value</em> pairs are valid.</p>
<p>If successful, <strong>graph</strong> returns the path name of the widget. It also creates a new Tcl command by the same name. You can use this command to invoke various operations that query or modify the graph. The general form is: <em>pathName</em> <em>operation</em> ?<em>arg</em>?... Both <em>operation</em> and its arguments determine the exact behavior of the command. The operations available for the graph are described in the <strong>GRAPH OPERATIONS</strong> section.</p>
<p>The command can also be used to access components of the graph. <em>pathName</em> <em>component</em> <em>operation</em> ?<em>arg</em>?... The operation, now located after the name of the component, is the function to be performed on that component. Each component has its own set of operations that manipulate that component. They will be described below in their own sections.</p>
<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>The <strong>graph</strong> command creates a new graph.</p>
<pre><code># Create a new graph.  Plotting area is black.
graph .g -plotbackground black</code></pre>
<p>A new Tcl command .g is also created. This command can be used to query and modify the graph. For example, to change the title of the graph to &quot;My Plot&quot;, you use the new command and the graph's <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code># Change the title.
.g configure -title &quot;My Plot&quot;</code></pre>
<p>A graph has several components. To access a particular component you use the component's name. For example, to add data elements, you use the new command and the <strong>element</strong> component.</p>
<pre><code># Create a new element named &quot;line1&quot;
.g element create line1 \
  -xdata { 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 } \
  -ydata { 26.18 50.46 72.85 93.31 111.86 128.47 143.14
     155.85 166.60 175.38 }</code></pre>
<p>The element's X-Y coordinates are specified using lists of numbers. Alternately, RBC vectors could be used to hold the X-Y coordinates.</p>
<pre><code># Create two vectors and add them to the graph.
vector xVec yVec
xVec set { 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2.0 }
yVec set { 26.18 50.46 72.85 93.31 111.86 128.47 143.14 155.85
  166.60 175.38 }
.g element create line1 -xdata xVec -ydata yVec</code></pre>
<p>The advantage of using vectors is that when you modify one, the graph is automatically redrawn to reflect the new values.</p>
<pre><code># Change the y coordinate of the first point.
set yVector(0) 25.18</code></pre>
<p>An element named e1 is now created in .b. It is automatically added to the display list of elements. You can use this list to control in what order elements are displayed. To query or reset the element display list, you use the element's <strong>show</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code># Get the current display list
set elemList [.b element show]
# Remove the first element so it won&#39;t be displayed.
.b element show [lrange $elemList 0 end]</code></pre>
<p>The element will be displayed by as many bars as there are data points (in this case there are ten). The bars will be drawn centered at the x-coordinate of the data point. All the bars will have the same attributes (colors, stipple, etc). The width of each bar is by default one unit. You can change this with using the <strong>-barwidth</strong> option.</p>
<pre><code># Change the X-Y coordinates of the first point.
set xVec(0) 0.18
set yVec(0) 25.18</code></pre>
<p>An element named line1 is now created in .g. By default, the element's label in the legend will be also line1. You can change the label, or specify no legend entry, again using the element's <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code># Don&#39;t display &quot;line1&quot; in the legend.
.g element configure line1 -label &quot;&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can configure more than just the element's label. An element has many attributes such as symbol type and size, dashed or solid lines, colors, line width, etc.</p>
<pre><code>.g element configure line1 -symbol square -color red \
  -dashes { 2 4 2 } -linewidth 2 -pixels 2c</code></pre>
<p>Four coordinate axes are automatically created: x, x2, y, and y2. And by default, elements are mapped onto the axes x and y. This can be changed with the <strong>-mapx</strong> and <strong>-mapy</strong> options.</p>
<pre><code># Map &quot;line1&quot; on the alternate Y-axis &quot;y2&quot;.
.g element configure line1 -mapy y2</code></pre>
<p>Axes can be configured in many ways too. For example, you change the scale of the Y-axis from linear to log using the <strong>axis</strong> component.</p>
<pre><code># Y-axis is log scale.
.g axis configure y -logscale yes</code></pre>
<p>One important way axes are used is to zoom in on a particular data region. Zooming is done by simply specifying new axis limits using the <strong>-min</strong> and <strong>-max</strong> configuration options.</p>
<pre><code>.g axis configure x -min 1.0 -max 1.5
.g axis configure y -min 12.0 -max 55.15</code></pre>
<p>To zoom interactively, you link the <strong>axis configure</strong> operations with some user interaction (such as pressing the mouse button), using the <strong>bind</strong> command. To convert between screen and graph coordinates, use the <strong>invtransform</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code># Click the button to set a new minimum
bind .g &lt;ButtonPress-1&gt; {
    %W axis configure x -min [%W axis invtransform x %x]
    %W axis configure x -min [%W axis invtransform x %y]
}</code></pre>
<p>By default, the limits of the axis are determined from data values. To reset back to the default limits, set the <strong>-min</strong> and <strong>-max</strong> options to the empty value.</p>
<pre><code># Reset the axes to autoscale again.
.g axis configure x -min {} -max {}
.g axis configure y -min {} -max {}</code></pre>
<p>By default, the legend is drawn in the right margin. You can change this or any legend configuration options using the <strong>legend</strong> component.</p>
<pre><code># Configure the legend font, color, and relief
.g legend configure -position left -relief raised \
  -font fixed -fg blue</code></pre>
<p>To prevent the legend from being displayed, turn on the <strong>-hide</strong> option.</p>
<pre><code># Don&#39;t display the legend.
.g legend configure -hide yes</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>graph</strong> widget has simple drawing procedures called markers. They can be used to highlight or annotate data in the graph. The types of markers available are bitmaps, images, polygons, lines, or windows. Markers can be used, for example, to mark or brush points. In this example, is a text marker that labels the data first point. Markers are created using the <strong>marker</strong> component.</p>
<pre><code># Create a label for the first data point of &quot;line1&quot;.
.g marker create text -name first_marker -coords { 0.2 26.18 } \
  -text &quot;start&quot; -anchor se -xoffset -10 -yoffset -10</code></pre>
<p>This creates a text marker named first_marker. It will display the text &quot;start&quot; near the coordinates of the first data point. The <strong>-anchor</strong>, <strong>-xoffset</strong>, and <strong>-yoffset</strong> options are used to display the marker above and to the left of the data point, so that the data point isn't covered by the marker. By default, markers are drawn last, on top of</p>
<dl>
<dt>data.</dt>
<dd><p>You can change this with the <strong>-under</strong> option.</p>
<h1 id="draw-the-label-before-elements-are-drawn.">Draw the label before elements are drawn.</h1>
<p>.g marker configure first_marker -under yes</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can add cross hairs or grid lines using the <strong>crosshairs</strong> and <strong>grid</strong> components.</p>
<pre><code># Display both cross hairs and grid lines.
.g crosshairs configure -hide no -color red
.g grid configure -hide no -dashes { 2 2 }
# Set up a binding to reposition the crosshairs.
bind .g &lt;Motion&gt; {
    .g crosshairs configure -position @%x,%y
}</code></pre>
<p>The crosshairs are repositioned as the mouse pointer is moved in the graph. The pointer X-Y coordinates define the center of the crosshairs.</p>
<p>Finally, to get hardcopy of the graph, use the <strong>postscript</strong> component.</p>
<pre><code># Print the graph into file &quot;file.ps&quot;
.g postscript output file.ps -maxpect yes -decorations no</code></pre>
<p>This generates a file file.ps containing the encapsulated PostScript of the graph. The option <strong>-maxpect</strong> says to scale the plot to the size of the page. Turning off the <strong>-decorations</strong> option denotes that no borders or color backgrounds should be drawn (i.e. the background of the margins, legend, and plotting area will be white).</p>

<h1 id="graph-components">GRAPH COMPONENTS</h1>
<p>A graph is composed of several components: coordinate axes, data elements, legend, grid, cross hairs, postscript, and annotation markers. Instead of one big set of configuration options and operations, the graph is partitioned, where each component has its own configuration options and operations that specifically control that aspect or part of the graph.</p>
<h2 id="axis-components">AXIS COMPONENTS</h2>
<p>Four coordinate axes are automatically created: two X-coordinate axes (x and x2) and two Y-coordinate axes (y, and y2). By default, the axis x is located in the bottom margin, y in the left margin, x2 in the top margin, and y2 in the right margin.</p>
<p>An axis consists of the axis line, title, major and minor ticks, and tick labels. Major ticks are drawn at uniform intervals along the axis. Each tick is labeled with its coordinate value. Minor ticks are drawn at uniform intervals within major ticks.</p>
<p>The range of the axis controls what region of data is plotted. Data points outside the minimum and maximum limits of the axis are not plotted. By default, the minimum and maximum limits are determined from the data, but you can reset either limit.</p>
<p>You can have several axes. To create an axis, invoke the axis component and its create operation.</p>
<pre><code># Create a new axis called &quot;tempAxis&quot;
.g axis create tempAxis</code></pre>
<p>You map data elements to an axis using the element's -mapy and -mapx configuration options. They specify the coordinate axes an element is mapped onto.</p>
<pre><code># Now map the tempAxis data to this axis.
.g element create &quot;e1&quot; -xdata $x -ydata $y -mapy tempAxis</code></pre>
<p>Any number of axes can be displayed simultaneously. They are drawn in the margins surrounding the plotting area. The default axes x and y are drawn in the bottom and left margins. The axes x2 and y2 are drawn in top and right margins. By default, only x and y are shown. Note that the axes can have different scales.</p>
<p>To display a different axis or more than one axis, you invoke one of the following components: <strong>xaxis</strong>, <strong>yaxis</strong>, <strong>x2axis</strong>, and <strong>y2axis</strong>. Each component has a <strong>use</strong> operation that designates the axis (or axes) to be drawn in that corresponding margin: <strong>xaxis</strong> in the bottom, <strong>yaxis</strong> in the left, <strong>x2axis</strong> in the top, and <strong>y2axis</strong> in the right.</p>
<pre><code># Display the axis tempAxis in the left margin.
.g yaxis use tempAxis</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>use</strong> operation takes a list of axis names as its last argument. This is the list of axes to be drawn in this margin.</p>
<p>You can configure axes in many ways. The axis scale can be linear or logarithmic. The values along the axis can either monotonically increase or decrease. If you need custom tick labels, you can specify a Tcl procedure to format the label any way you wish. You can control how ticks are drawn, by changing the major tick interval or the number of minor ticks. You can define non-uniform tick intervals, such as for time-series plots.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>axis bind</strong> <em>tagName</em> ?<em>sequence</em>? ?<em>command</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Associates <em>command</em> with <em>tagName</em> such that whenever the event sequence given by <em>sequence</em> occurs for an axis with this tag, <em>command</em> will be invoked. The syntax is similar to the <strong>bind</strong> command except that it operates on graph axes, rather than widgets. See the <strong>bind</strong> manual entry for complete details on <em>sequence</em> and the substitutions performed on <em>command</em> before invoking it.</p>
<p>If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing binding for the same <em>sequence</em> and <em>tagName</em>. If the first character of <em>command</em> is + then <em>command</em> augments an existing binding rather than replacing it. If no <em>command</em> argument is provided then the command currently associated with <em>tagName</em> and <em>sequence</em> (it's an error occurs if there's no such binding) is returned. If both <em>command</em> and <em>sequence</em> are missing then a list of all the event sequences for which bindings have been defined for <em>tagName</em>.</p>

<p>The default axes are x, y, x2, and y2. But you can display more than four axes simultaneously. You can also swap in a different axis with <strong>use</strong> operation of the special axis components: <strong>xaxis</strong>, <strong>x2axis</strong>, <strong>yaxis</strong>, and <strong>y2axis</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>.g create axis temp
.g create axis time
...
.g xaxis use temp
.g yaxis use time</code></pre>
<p>Only the axes specified for use are displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>xaxis</strong>, <strong>x2axis</strong>, <strong>yaxis</strong>, and <strong>y2axis</strong> components operate on an axis location rather than a specific axis like the more general <strong>axis</strong> component does. They implicitly control the axis that is currently using to that location. By default, <strong>xaxis</strong> uses the x axis, <strong>yaxis</strong> uses y, <strong>x2axis</strong> uses x2, and <strong>y2axis</strong> uses y2. When more than one axis is displayed in a margin, it represents the first axis displayed.</p>
<p>The following operations are available for axes. They mirror exactly the operations of the <strong>axis</strong> component. The <em>axis</em> argument must be <strong>xaxis</strong>, <strong>x2axis</strong>, <strong>yaxis</strong>, or <strong>y2axis</strong>. This feature is deprecated since more than one axis can now be used a margin. You should only use the <strong>xaxis</strong>, <strong>x2axis</strong>, <strong>yaxis</strong>, and <strong>y2axis</strong> components with the <strong>use</strong> operation. For all other operations, use the general <strong>axis</strong> component instead.</p>

<h2 id="pen-components">PEN COMPONENTS</h2>
<p>Pens define attributes (both symbol and line style) for elements. Pens mirror the configuration options of data elements that pertain to how symbols and lines are drawn. Data elements use pens to determine how they are drawn. A data element may use several pens at once. In this case, the pen used for a particular data point is determined from each element's weight vector (see the element's <strong>-weight</strong> and <strong>-style</strong> options).</p>
<p>One pen, called activeLine, is automatically created. It's used as the default active pen for elements. So you can change the active attributes for all elements by simply reconfiguring this pen.</p>
<pre><code>.g pen configure &quot;activeLine&quot; -color green</code></pre>
<p>You can create and use several pens. To create a pen, invoke the pen component and its create operation.</p>
<pre><code>.g pen create myPen</code></pre>
<p>You map pens to a data element using either the element's <strong>-pen</strong> or <strong>-activepen</strong> options.</p>
<pre><code>.g element create &quot;line1&quot; -xdata $x -ydata $tempData \
    -pen myPen</code></pre>
<p>An element can use several pens at once. This is done by specifying the name of the pen in the element's style list (see the <strong>-styles</strong> option).</p>
<pre><code>.g element configure &quot;line1&quot; -styles { myPen 2.0 3.0 }</code></pre>
<p>This says that any data point with a weight between 2.0 and 3.0 is to be drawn using the pen myPen. All other points are drawn with the element's default attributes.</p>
<p>The following operations are available for pen components.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>pen cget</strong> <em>penName</em> <em>option</em></dt>

If one or more <em>option</em> and <em>value</em> pairs are specified, then for each pair, the postscript option <em>option</em> is set to <em>value</em>. The following postscript options are available.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-center <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd>Indicates whether the plot should be centered on the PostScript page. If <em>boolean</em> is false, the plot will be placed in the upper left corner of the page. The default is 1.
</dd>
<dt>-colormap <em>varName</em></dt>
<dd><em>VarName</em> must be the name of a global array variable that specifies a color mapping from the X color name to PostScript. Each element of <em>varName</em> must consist of PostScript code to set a particular color value (e.g. ``1.0 1.0 0.0 setrgbcolor''). When generating color information in PostScript, the array variable <em>varName</em> is checked if an element of the name as the color exists. If so, it uses its value as the PostScript command to set the color. If this option hasn't been specified, or if there isn't an entry in <em>varName</em> for a given color, then it uses the red, green, and blue intensities from the X color.
</dd>
<dt>-colormode <em>mode</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies how to output color information. <em>Mode</em> must be either color (for full color output), gray (convert all colors to their gray-scale equivalents) or mono (convert foreground colors to black and background colors to white). The default mode is color.
</dd>
<dt>-fontmap <em>varName</em></dt>
<dd><em>VarName</em> must be the name of a global array variable that specifies a font mapping from the X font name to PostScript. Each element of <em>varName</em> must consist of a Tcl list with one or two elements; the name and point size of a PostScript font. When outputting PostScript commands for a particular font, the array variable <em>varName</em> is checked to see if an element by the specified font exists. If there is such an element, then the font information contained in that element is used in the PostScript output. (If the point size is omitted from the list, the point size of the X font is used). Otherwise the X font is examined in an attempt to guess what PostScript font to use. This works only for fonts whose foundry property is <em>Adobe</em> (such as Times, Helvetica, Courier, etc.). If all of this fails then the font defaults to Helvetica-Bold.
</dd>
<dt>-decorations <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd>Indicates whether PostScript commands to generate color backgrounds and 3-D borders will be output. If <em>boolean</em> is false, the background will be white and no 3-D borders will be generated. The default is 1.
</dd>
<dt>-height <em>pixels</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the height of the plot. This lets you print the graph with a height different from the one drawn on the screen. If <em>pixels</em> is 0, the height is the same as the widget's height. The default is 0.
</dd>
<dt>-landscape <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd>If <em>boolean</em> is true, this specifies the printed area is to be rotated 90 degrees. In non-rotated output the X-axis of the printed area runs along the short dimension of the page (``portrait'' orientation); in rotated output the X-axis runs along the long dimension of the page (``landscape'' orientation). Defaults to 0.
</dd>
<dt>-maxpect <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd>Indicates to scale the plot so that it fills the PostScript page. The aspect ratio of the graph is still retained. The default is 0.
</dd>
<dt>-padx <em>pad</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the horizontal padding for the left and right page borders. The borders are exterior to the plot. <em>Pad</em> can be a list of one or two screen distances. If <em>pad</em> has two elements, the left border is padded by the first distance and the right border by the second. If <em>pad</em> has just one distance, both the left and right borders are padded evenly. The default is 1i.
</dd>
<dt>-pady <em>pad</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the vertical padding for the top and bottom page borders. The borders are exterior to the plot. <em>Pad</em> can be a list of one or two screen distances. If <em>pad</em> has two elements, the top border is padded by the first distance and the bottom border by the second. If <em>pad</em> has just one distance, both the top and bottom borders are padded evenly. The default is 1i.
</dd>
<dt>-paperheight <em>pixels</em></dt>

<p>Markers are simple drawing procedures used to annotate or highlight areas of the graph. Markers have various types: text strings, bitmaps, images, connected lines, windows, or polygons. They can be associated with a particular element, so that when the element is hidden or un- hidden, so is the marker. By default, markers are the last items drawn, so that data elements will appear in behind them. You can change this by configuring the <strong>-under</strong> option.</p>
<p>Markers, in contrast to elements, don't affect the scaling of the coordinate axes. They can also have <em>elastic</em> coordinates (specified by -Inf and Inf respectively) that translate into the minimum or maximum limit of the axis. For example, you can place a marker so it always remains in the lower left corner of the plotting area, by using the coordinates -Inf,-Inf.</p>
<p>The following operations are available for markers.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>marker after</strong> <em>markerId</em> ?<em>afterId</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Changes the order of the markers, drawing the first marker after the second. If no second <em>afterId</em> argument is specified, the marker is placed at the end of the display list. This command can be used to control how markers are displayed since markers are drawn in the order of this display list.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>marker before</strong> <em>markerId</em> ?<em>beforeId</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Changes the order of the markers, drawing the first marker before the second. If no second <em>beforeId</em> argument is specified, the marker is placed at the beginning of the display list. This command can be used to control how markers are displayed since markers are drawn in the order of this display list.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>marker bind</strong> <em>tagName</em> ?<em>sequence</em>? ?<em>command</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Associates <em>command</em> with <em>tagName</em> such that whenever the event sequence given by <em>sequence</em> occurs for a marker with this tag, <em>command</em> will be invoked. The syntax is similar to the <strong>bind</strong> command except that it operates on graph markers, rather than widgets. See the <strong>bind</strong> manual entry for complete details on <em>sequence</em> and the substitutions performed on <em>command</em> before invoking it.</p>
<p>If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing binding for the same <em>sequence</em> and <em>tagName</em>. If the first character of <em>command</em> is + then <em>command</em> augments an existing binding rather than replacing it. If no <em>command</em> argument is provided then the command currently associated with <em>tagName</em> and <em>sequence</em> (it's an error occurs if there's no such binding) is returned. If both <em>command</em> and <em>sequence</em> are missing then a list of all the event sequences for which bindings have been defined for <em>tagName</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>marker cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the current value of the marker configuration option given by <em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may be any option described below in the <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>marker configure</strong> <em>markerId</em> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?...</dt>
<dd><p>Queries or modifies the configuration options for markers. If <em>option</em> isn't specified, a list describing the current options for <em>markerId</em> is returned. If <em>option</em> is specified, but not <em>value</em>, then a list describing <em>option</em> is returned. If one or more <em>option</em> and <em>value</em> pairs are specified, then for each pair, the marker option <em>option</em> is set to <em>value</em>.</p>
<p>The following options are valid for all markers. Each type of marker also has its own type-specific options. They are described in the sections below.</p>
<dl>
<dt>-bindtags <em>tagList</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the binding tags for the marker. <em>TagList</em> is a list of binding tag names. The tags and their order will determine how events for markers are handled. Each tag in the list matching the current event sequence will have its Tcl command executed. Implicitly the name of the marker is always the first tag in the list. The default value is all.
</dd>
<dt>-coords <em>coordList</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the coordinates of the marker. <em>CoordList</em> is a list of graph coordinates. The number of coordinates required is dependent on the type of marker. Text, image, and window markers need only two coordinates (an X-Y coordinate). Bitmap markers can take either two or four coordinates (if four, they represent the corners of the bitmap). Line markers need at least four coordinates, polygons at least six. If <em>coordList</em> is &quot;&quot;, the marker will not be displayed. The default is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>-element <em>elemName</em></dt>
<dd>Links the marker with the element <em>elemName</em>. The marker is drawn only if the element is also currently displayed (see the element's <strong>show</strong> operation). If <em>elemName</em> is &quot;&quot;, the marker is always drawn. The default is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>-hide <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd>Indicates whether the marker is drawn. If <em>boolean</em> is true, the marker is not drawn. The default is no.
</dd>
<dt>-mapx <em>xAxis</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the X-axis to map the marker's X-coordinates onto. <em>XAxis</em> must the name of an axis. The default is x.
</dd>
<dt>-mapy <em>yAxis</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the Y-axis to map the marker's Y-coordinates onto. <em>YAxis</em> must the name of an axis. The default is y.
</dd>
<dt>-name <em>markerId</em></dt>
<dd>Changes the identifier for the marker. The identifier <em>markerId</em> can not already be used by another marker. If this option isn't specified, the marker's name is uniquely generated.
</dd>
<dt>-under <em>boolean</em></dt>
<dd>Indicates whether the marker is drawn below/above data elements. If <em>boolean</em> is true, the marker is be drawn underneath the data element symbols and lines. Otherwise, the marker is drawn on top of the element. The default is 0.
</dd>
<dt>-xoffset <em>pixels</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies a screen distance to offset the marker horizontally. <em>Pixels</em> is a valid screen distance, such as 2 or 1.2i. The default is 0.
</dd>
<dt>-yoffset <em>pixels</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies a screen distance to offset the markers vertically. <em>Pixels</em> is a valid screen distance, such as 2 or 1.2i. The default is 0.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Marker configuration options may also be set by the <strong>option</strong> command. The resource class is either BitmapMarker, ImageMarker, LineMarker, PolygonMarker, TextMarker, or WindowMarker, depending on the type of marker. The resource name is the name of the marker.</p>
<p>option add *Graph.TextMarker.Foreground white option add *Graph.BitmapMarker.Foreground white option add *Graph.m1.Background blue</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>marker create</strong> <em>type</em> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?...</dt>
<dd><p>Creates a marker of the selected type. <em>Type</em> may be either text, line, bitmap, image, polygon, or window. This command returns the marker identifier, used as the <em>markerId</em> argument in the other marker-related commands. If the <strong>-name</strong> option is used, this overrides the normal marker identifier. If the name provided is already used for another marker, the new marker will replace the old.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>marker delete</strong> ?<em>name</em>?...</dt>
<dd><p>Removes one of more markers. The graph will automatically be redrawn without the marker..</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>marker exists</strong> <em>markerId</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns 1 if the marker <em>markerId</em> exists and 0 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>marker names</strong> ?<em>pattern</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Returns the names of all the markers that currently exist. If <em>pattern</em> is supplied, only those markers whose names match it will be returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>marker type</strong> <em>markerId</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the type of the marker given by <em>markerId</em>, such as line or text. If <em>markerId</em> is not a valid a marker identifier, &quot;&quot; is returned.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="bitmap-markers">BITMAP MARKERS</h2>
<p>A bitmap marker displays a bitmap. The size of the bitmap is controlled by the number of coordinates specified. If two coordinates, they specify the position of the top-left corner of the bitmap. The bitmap retains its normal width and height. If four coordinates, the first and second pairs of coordinates represent the corners of the bitmap. The bitmap will be stretched or reduced as necessary to fit into the bounding rectangle.</p>
<p>Bitmap markers are created with the marker's <strong>create</strong> operation in the form: <em>pathName</em> <strong>marker create bitmap</strong> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?... There may be many <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each sets a configuration options for the marker. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used with the marker's <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
<p>The following options are specific to bitmap markers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-background <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Same as the <strong>-fill</strong> option.
</dd>
<dt>-bitmap <em>bitmap</em></dt>

</dd>
<dt>-foreground <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Same as the <strong>-outline</strong> option.
</dd>
<dt>-mask <em>mask</em></dt>

<dt>-outline <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the foreground color of the bitmap. The default value is black.
</dd>
<dt>-rotate <em>theta</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the rotation of the bitmap. <em>Theta</em> is a real number representing the angle of rotation in degrees. The marker is first rotated and then placed according to its anchor position. The default rotation is 0.0.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="image-markers">IMAGE MARKERS</h2>
<p>A image marker displays an image. Image markers are created with the marker's <strong>create</strong> operation in the form: <em>pathName</em> <strong>marker create image</strong> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?... There may be many <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each sets a configuration option for the marker. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used with the marker's <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
<p>The following options are specific to image markers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-anchor <em>anchor</em></dt>
<dd><em>Anchor</em> tells how to position the image relative to the positioning point for the image. For example, if <em>anchor</em> is center then the image is centered on the point; if <em>anchor</em> is n then the image will be drawn such that the top center point of the rectangular region occupied by the image will be at the positioning point. This option defaults to center.
</dd>
<dt>-image <em>image</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the image to be drawn. If <em>image</em> is &quot;&quot;, the marker will not be drawn. The default is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="line-markers">LINE MARKERS</h2>
<p>A line marker displays one or more connected line segments. Line markers are created with marker's <strong>create</strong> operation in the form: <em>pathName</em> <strong>marker create line</strong> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?... There may be many <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each sets a configuration option for the marker. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used with the marker's <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
<p>The following options are specific to line markers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-dashes <em>dashList</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the dash style of the line. <em>DashList</em> is a list of up to 11 numbers that alternately represent the lengths of the dashes and gaps on the line. Each number must be between 1 and 255. If <em>dashList</em> is &quot;&quot;, the marker line will be solid.
</dd>
<dt>-fill <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the background color of the line. This color is used with striped lines (see the <strong>-fdashes</strong> option). If <em>color</em> is the empty string, no background color is drawn (the line will be dashed, not striped). The default background color is &quot;&quot;.

<dt>-stipple <em>bitmap</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies a stipple pattern used to draw the line, rather than a solid line. <em>Bitmap</em> specifies a bitmap to use as the stipple pattern. If <em>bitmap</em> is &quot;&quot;, then the line is drawn in a solid fashion. The default is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="polygon-markers">POLYGON MARKERS</h2>
<p>A polygon marker displays a closed region described as two or more connected line segments. It is assumed the first and last points are connected. Polygon markers are created using the marker <strong>create</strong> operation in the form: <em>pathName</em> <strong>marker create polygon</strong> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?... There may be many <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each sets a configuration option for the marker. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used with the <strong>marker configure</strong> command to change the marker's configuration. The following options are supported for polygon markers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-dashes <em>dashList</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the dash style of the outline of the polygon. <em>DashList</em> is a list of up to 11 numbers that alternately represent the lengths of the dashes and gaps on the outline. Each number must be between 1 and 255. If <em>dashList</em> is &quot;&quot;, the outline will be a solid line.
</dd>
<dt>-fill <em>color</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the fill color of the polygon. If <em>color</em> is &quot;&quot;, then the interior of the polygon is transparent. The default is white.
</dd>
<dt>-linewidth <em>pixels</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the width of the outline of the polygon. If <em>pixels</em> is zero, no outline is drawn. The default is 0.
</dd>
<dt>-outline <em>color</em></dt>

<dd>Specifies that the polygon should be drawn with a stippled pattern rather than a solid color. <em>Bitmap</em> specifies a bitmap to use as the stipple pattern. If <em>bitmap</em> is &quot;&quot;, then the polygon is filled with a solid color (if the <strong>-fill</strong> option is set). The default is &quot;&quot;.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="text-markers">TEXT MARKERS</h2>
<p>A text marker displays a string of characters on one or more lines of text. Embedded newlines cause line breaks. They may be used to annotate regions of the graph. Text markers are created with the <strong>create</strong> operation in the form: <em>pathName</em> <strong>marker create text</strong> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?... There may be many <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each sets a configuration option for the text marker. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used with the marker's <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
<p>The following options are specific to text markers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-anchor <em>anchor</em></dt>
<dd><em>Anchor</em> tells how to position the text relative to the positioning point for the text. For example, if <em>anchor</em> is center then the text is centered on the point; if <em>anchor</em> is n then the text will be drawn such that the top center point of the rectangular region occupied by the text will be at the positioning point.

<dd>Sets the color of the text. The default value is black.
</dd>
<dt>-padx <em>pad</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the padding to the left and right exteriors of the text. <em>Pad</em> can be a list of one or two screen distances. If <em>pad</em> has two elements, the left side of the text is padded by the first distance and the right side by the second. If <em>pad</em> has just one distance, both the left and right sides are padded evenly. The default is 4.
</dd>
<dt>-pady <em>pad</em></dt>
<dd>Sets the padding above and below the text. <em>Pad</em> can be a list of one or two screen distances. If <em>pad</em> has two elements, the area above the text is padded by the first distance and the area below by the second. If <em>pad</em> is just one distance, both the top and bottom areas are padded evenly. The default is 4.
</dd>
<dt>-rotate <em>theta</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the number of degrees to rotate the text. <em>Theta</em> is a real number representing the angle of rotation. The marker is first rotated along its center and is then drawn according to its anchor position. The default is 0.0.
</dd>
<dt>-text <em>text</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the text of the marker. The exact way the text is displayed may be affected by other options such as <strong>-anchor</strong> or <strong>-rotate</strong>.

<h2 id="window-markers">WINDOW MARKERS</h2>
<p>A window marker displays a widget at a given position. Window markers are created with the marker's <strong>create</strong> operation in the form: <em>pathName</em> <strong>marker create window</strong> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?... There may be many <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs, each sets a configuration option for the marker. These same <em>option</em>-<em>value</em> pairs may be used with the marker's <strong>configure</strong> command.</p>
<p>The following options are specific to window markers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-anchor <em>anchor</em></dt>
<dd><em>Anchor</em> tells how to position the widget relative to the positioning point for the widget. For example, if <em>anchor</em> is center then the widget is centered on the point; if <em>anchor</em> is n then the widget will be displayed such that the top center point of the rectangular region occupied by the widget will be at the positioning point. This option defaults to center.
</dd>
<dt>-height <em>pixels</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the height to assign to the marker's window. If this option isn't specified, or if it is specified as &quot;&quot;, then the window is given whatever height the widget requests internally.
</dd>
<dt>-width <em>pixels</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the width to assign to the marker's window. If this option isn't specified, or if it is specified as &quot;&quot;, then the window is given whatever width the widget requests internally.

<dt>-window <em>pathName</em></dt>
<dd>Specifies the widget to be managed by the graph. <em>PathName</em> must be a child of the <strong>graph</strong> widget.
</dd>
</dl>
<h1 id="graph-component-bindings">GRAPH COMPONENT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Specific graph components, such as elements, markers and legend entries, can have a command trigger when event occurs in them, much like canvas items in Tk's canvas widget. Not all event sequences are valid. The only binding events that may be specified are those related to the mouse and keyboard (such as <strong>Enter</strong>, <strong>Leave</strong>, <strong>ButtonPress</strong>, <strong>Motion</strong>, and <strong>KeyPress</strong>).</p>
<p>Only one element or marker can be picked during an event. This means, that if the mouse is directly over both an element and a marker, only the uppermost component is selected. This isn't true for legend entries. Both a legend entry and an element (or marker) binding commands will be invoked if both items are picked.</p>
<p>It is possible for multiple bindings to match a particular event. This could occur, for example, if one binding is associated with the element name and another is associated with one of the element's tags (see the <strong>-bindtags</strong> option). When this occurs, all of the matching bindings are invoked. A binding associated with the element name is invoked first, followed by one binding for each of the element's bindtags. If there are multiple matching bindings for a single tag, then only the most specific binding is invoked. A continue command in a binding script terminates that script, and a break command terminates that script and skips any remaining scripts for the event, just as for the bind command.</p>
<p>The <strong>-bindtags</strong> option for these components controls addition tag names which can be matched. Implicitly elements and markers always have tags matching their names. Setting the value of the <strong>-bindtags</strong> option doesn't change this.</p>
<h1 id="c-language-api">C LANGUAGE API</h1>
<p>You can manipulate data elements from the C language. There may be situations where it is too expensive to translate the data values from ASCII strings. Or you might want to read data in a special file format.</p>
<p>Data can manipulated from the C language using RBC vectors. You specify the X-Y data coordinates of an element as vectors and manipulate the vector from C. The graph will be redrawn automatically after the vectors are updated.</p>
<p>From Tcl, create the vectors and configure the element to use them.</p>
<pre><code>vector X Y
.g element configure line1 -xdata X -ydata Y</code></pre>
<p>To set data points from C, you pass the values as arrays of doubles using the <strong>Rbc_ResetVector</strong> call. The vector is reset with the new data and at the next idle point (when Tk re-enters its event loop), the graph will be redrawn automatically.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;tcl.h&gt;
#include &lt;rbc.h&gt;

register int i;
Rbc_Vector *xVec, *yVec;
double x[50], y[50];

/* Get the RBC vectors &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; (created above from Tcl) */
if ((Rbc_GetVector(interp, &quot;X&quot;, &amp;xVec) != TCL_OK) ||
    (Rbc_GetVector(interp, &quot;Y&quot;, &amp;yVec) != TCL_OK)) {
    return TCL_ERROR;
}

for (i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++) {
    x[i] = i * 0.02;
    y[i] = sin(x[i]);
}

/* Put the data into RBC vectors */
if ((Rbc_ResetVector(xVec, x, 50, 50, TCL_VOLATILE) != TCL_OK) ||
    (Rbc_ResetVector(yVec, y, 50, 50, TCL_VOLATILE) != TCL_OK)) {
   return TCL_ERROR;
}</code></pre>
<p>See the <strong>vector</strong> manual page for more details.</p>
<h1 id="speed-tips">SPEED TIPS</h1>
<p>There may be cases where the graph needs to be drawn and updated as quickly as possible. If drawing speed becomes a big problem, here are a few tips to speed up displays.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Try to minimize the number of data points. The more data points the looked at, the more work the graph must do.</p></li>
<li><p>If your data is generated as floating point values, the time required to convert the data values to and from ASCII strings can be significant, especially when there any many data points. You can avoid the redundant string-to-decimal conversions using the C API to RBC vectors.</p></li>
<li><p>Data elements without symbols are drawn faster than with symbols. Set the data element's <strong>-symbol</strong> option to none. If you need to draw symbols, try using the simple symbols such as splus and scross.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't stipple or dash the element. Solid lines are much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>If you update data elements frequently, try turning off the widget's <strong>-bufferelements</strong> option. When the graph is first displayed, it draws data elements into an internal pixmap. The pixmap acts as a cache, so that when the graph needs to be redrawn again, and the data elements or coordinate axes haven't changed, the pixmap is simply copied to the screen. This is especially useful when you are using markers to highlight points and regions on the graph. But if the graph is updated frequently, changing either the element data or coordinate axes, the buffering becomes redundant.</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="limitations">LIMITATIONS</h1>
<p>Auto-scale routines do not use requested min/max limits as boundaries when the axis is logarithmically scaled.</p>
<p>The PostScript output generated for polygons with more than 1500 points may exceed the limits of some printers (See PostScript Language Reference Manual, page 568). The work-around is to break the polygon into separate pieces.</p>
