<h1 id="name">NAME</h1>
<p>treeview - Create and manipulate hierarchical table widgets</p>
<h1 id="synopsis">SYNOPSIS</h1>
<p><strong>treeview</strong> <em>pathName</em> ?<em>options</em>?</p>
<h1 id="description">DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>treeview</strong> widget displays a tree of data. It replaces both the <strong>hiertable</strong> and <strong>hierbox</strong> widgets. The <strong>treeview</strong> is 100% syntax compatible with the <strong>hiertable</strong> widget. The <strong>hiertable</strong> command is retained for sake of script-level compatibility. This widget obsoletes the <strong>hierbox</strong> widget. It does everything the old <strong>hierbox</strong> widget did, but also provides data sharing (via <em>tree</em> <em>data</em> <em>objects</em>) and the ability to tag nodes.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>The <strong>treeview</strong> widget displays hierarchical data. Data is represented as nodes in a general-ordered tree. Each node may have sub-nodes and these nodes can in turn has their own children.</p>
<p>A node is displayed as a row entry in the widget. Each entry has a text label and icon. When a node has children, its entry is drawn with a small button to the left of the label. Clicking the mouse over this button opens or closes the node. When a node is <em>open</em>, its children are exposed. When it is <em>closed</em>, the children and their descedants are hidden. The button is normally a + or - symbol (ala Windows Explorer), but can be replaced with a pair of Tk images (open and closed images).</p>
<p>If the node has data associated with it, they can be displayed in columns running vertically on either side the tree. You can control the color, font, etc of each entry. Any entry label or data field can be edited in-place.</p>
<h1 id="tree-data-object">TREE DATA OBJECT</h1>
<p>The tree is not stored inside the widget but in a tree data object (see the <strong>tree</strong> command for a further explanation). Tree data objects can be shared among different clients, such as a <strong>treeview</strong> widget or the <strong>tree</strong> command. You can walk the tree and manage its data with the <strong>tree</strong> command tree, while displaying it with the <strong>treeview</strong> widget. Whenever the tree is updated, the <strong>treeview</strong> widget is automatically redrawn.</p>
<p>By default, the <strong>treeview</strong> widget creates its own tree object. The tree initially contains just a root node. But you can also display trees created by the <strong>tree</strong> command using the <strong>-tree</strong> configuration option. <strong>Treeview</strong> widgets can share the same tree object, possibly displaying different views of the same data.</p>
<p>A tree object has both a Tcl and C API. You can insert or delete nodes using <strong>treeview</strong> widget or <strong>tree</strong> command operations, but also from C code. For example, you can load the tree from your C code while still managing and displaying the tree from Tcl. The widget is automatically notified whenever the tree is modified via C or Tcl.</p>
<h1 id="syntax">SYNTAX</h1>
<p><strong>treeview</strong> <em>pathName</em> ?<em>option</em> <em>value</em>?... The <strong>treeview</strong> command creates a new window <em>pathName</em> and makes it into a <strong>treeview</strong> widget. At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named <em>pathName</em>, but <em>pathName</em>'s parent must exist. Additional options may be specified on the command line or in the option database to configure aspects of the widget such as its colors and font. See the <strong>configure</strong> operation below for the exact details about what <em>option</em> and <em>value</em> pairs are valid.</p>
<p>If successful, <strong>treeview</strong> returns the path name of the widget. It also creates a new Tcl command by the same name. You can use this command to invoke various operations that query or modify the widget. The general form is: <em>pathName</em> <em>operation</em> ?<em>arg</em>?... Both <em>operation</em> and its arguments determine the exact behavior of the command. The operations available are described in the <strong>TREEVIEW OPERATIONS</strong> section.</p>
<h1 id="ids-and-tags">IDS AND TAGS</h1>
<p>Nodes can be inserted into a tree using the <strong>treeview</strong> widget</p>
<pre><code>rbc::treeview .t
set node [.t insert end root &quot;one&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>or <strong>tree</strong> command.</p>
<pre><code>set tree [rbc::tree create]
set node [$tree insert root &quot;one&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>In both cases, a number identifying the node is returned (the value of $node). This serial number or <em>id</em> uniquely identifies the node. Please note that you can't infer a location or position of a node from its id. The only exception is that the root node is always id 0. Since nodes may have the same labels or be moved within the tree, ids provide an convenient way to identify nodes. If a tree is shared, the ids will be the same regardless if you are using by the <strong>treeview</strong> widget or the <strong>tree</strong> command. Ids are recycled when the node deleted.</p>
<p>A node may also have any number of <em>tags</em> associated with it. A tag is just a string of characters, and it may take any form except that of an integer. For example, &quot;x123&quot; is valid, but &quot;123&quot; isn't. The same tag may be associated with many different nodes. This is typically done to associate a group of nodes. Many operations in the <strong>treeview</strong> widget take either node ids or tag names as arguments. Using a tag says to apply the operation to all nodes with that tag.</p>
<p>The tag <strong>all</strong> is implicitly associated with every node in the tree. It may be used to invoke operations on all the nodes in the tree.</p>
<p>Tags may be shared, just like trees, between clients. For example, you can use the tags created by the <strong>tree</strong> command with <strong>treeview</strong> widgets.</p>
<h1 id="special-node-ids">SPECIAL NODE IDS</h1>
<p>There are also several special non-numeric ids. Special ids differ from tags in that they are always translated to their numeric equivalent. They also take precedence over tags. For example, you can't use a tag name that is a special id. These ids are specific to the <strong>treeview</strong> widget.</p>
<dl>
<dt>active</dt>
<dd>The node where the mouse pointer is currently located. When a node is active, it is drawn using its active icon (see the <strong>-activeicon</strong> option). The <strong>active</strong> id is changed automatically by moving the mouse pointer over another node or by using the <strong>entry activate</strong> operation. Note that there can be only one active node at a time.
</dd>
<dt>anchor</dt>
<dd>The node representing the fixed end of the current selection. The anchor is set by the <strong>selection anchor</strong> operation.
</dd>
<dt>current</dt>
<dd>The node where the mouse pointer is currently located. But unlike <strong>active</strong>, this id changes while the selection is dragged. It is used to determine the current node during button drags.
</dd>
<dt>down</dt>
<dd>The next open node from the current focus. The <strong>down</strong> of the last open node is the same.
</dd>
<dt>end</dt>
<dd>The last open node (in depth-first order) on the tree.
</dd>
<dt>focus</dt>
<dd>The node that currently has focus. When a node has focus, it receives key events. To indicate focus, the node is drawn with a dotted line around its label. You can change the focus using the <strong>focus</strong> operation.
</dd>
<dt>last</dt>
<dd>The last open node from the current focus. But unlike <strong>up</strong>, when the focus is at root, <strong>last</strong> wraps around to the last open node in the tree.
</dd>
<dt>mark</dt>
<dd>The node representing the non-fixed end of the current selection. The mark is set by the <strong>selection mark</strong> operation.
</dd>
<dt>next</dt>
<dd>The next open node from the current focus. But unlike <strong>down</strong>, when the focus is on last open node, <strong>next</strong> wraps around to the root node.
</dd>
<dt>nextsibling</dt>
<dd>The next sibling from the node with the current focus. If the node is already the last sibling then it is the <strong>nextsibling.</strong>
</dd>
<dt>parent</dt>
<dd>The parent of the node with the current focus. The <strong>parent</strong> of the root is also the root.
</dd>
<dt>prevsibling</dt>
<dd>The previous sibling from the node with the current focus. If the node is already the first sibling then it is the <strong>prevsibling.</strong>
</dd>
<dt>root</dt>
<dd>The root node. You can also use id 0 to indicate the root.
</dd>
<dt>up</dt>
<dd>The last open node (in depth-first order) from the current focus. The <strong>up</strong> of the root node (i.e. the root has focus) is also the root.
</dd>
<dt>view.top</dt>
<dd>First node that's current visible in the widget.
</dd>
<dt>view.bottom</dt>
<dd>Last node that's current visible in the widget.
</dd>
<dt><em>path</em></dt>
<dd>Absolute path of a node. Path names refer to the node name, not their entry labels. Paths don't have to start with a separator (see the <strong>-separator</strong> configuration option), but component names must be separated by the designated separator.
</dd>
<dt>@<em>x</em>,<em>y</em></dt>
<dd>Indicates the node that covers the point in the treeview window specified by <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> (in pixel coordinates). If no part of the entryd covers that point, then the closest node to that point is used.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>A node may be specified as an id or tag. If the specifier is an integer then it is assumed to refer to the single node with that id. If the specifier is not an integer, it's checked to see if it's a special id (such as focus). Otherwise, it's assumed to be tag. Some operations only operate on a single node at a time; if a tag refers to more than one node, then an error is generated.</p>
<h1 id="data-fields">DATA FIELDS</h1>
<p>A node in the tree can have <em>data</em> <em>fields</em>. A data field is a name-value pair, used to represent arbitrary data in the node. Nodes can contain different fields (they aren't required to contain the same fields). You can optionally display these fields in the <strong>treeview</strong> widget in columns running on either side of the displayed tree. A node's value for the field is drawn in the column along side its node in the hierarchy. Any node that doesn't have a specific field is left blank. Columns can be interactively resized, hidden, or, moved.</p>
<h1 id="entry-bindings">ENTRY BINDINGS</h1>
<p>You can bind Tcl commands to be invoked when events occur on nodes (much like Tk canvas items). You can bind a node using its id or its <em>bindtags</em>. Bindtags are simply names that associate a binding with one or more nodes. There is a built-in tag all that all node entries automatically have.</p>
<h1 id="treeview-operations">TREEVIEW OPERATIONS</h1>
<p>The <strong>treeview</strong> operations are the invoked by specifying the widget's pathname, the operation, and any arguments that pertain to that operation. The general form is:</p>
<pre><code>pathName operation ?arg arg ...?</code></pre>
<p><em>Operation</em> and the <em>arg</em>s determine the exact behavior of the command. The following operation are available for <strong>treeview</strong> widgets:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>bbox</strong> ?<strong>-screen</strong>? <em>tagOrId...</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns a list of 4 numbers, representing a bounding box of around the specified entries. The entries is given by one or more <em>tagOrId</em> arguments. If the <strong>-screen</strong> flag is given, then the x-y coordinates of the bounding box are returned as screen coordinates, not virtual coordinates. Virtual coordinates start from 0 from the root node. The returned list contains the following values.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>x</em></dt>
<dd>X-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding box.
</dd>
<dt><em>y</em></dt>
<dd>Y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the bounding box.
</dd>
<dt><em>width</em></dt>
<dd>Width of the bounding box.
</dd>
<dt><em>height</em></dt>
<dd>Height of the bounding box.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>bind</strong> <em>tagName</em> ?<em>sequence</em> <em>command</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Associates <em>command</em> with <em>tagName</em> such that whenever the event sequence given by <em>sequence</em> occurs for a node with this tag, <em>command</em> will be invoked. The syntax is similar to the <strong>bind</strong> command except that it operates on <strong>treeview</strong> entries, rather than widgets. See the <strong>bind</strong> manual entry for complete details on <em>sequence</em> and the substitutions performed on <em>command</em> before invoking it.</p>
<p>If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing binding for the same <em>sequence</em> and <em>tagName</em>. If the first character of <em>command</em> is + then <em>command</em> augments an existing binding rather than replacing it. If no <em>command</em> argument is provided then the command currently associated with <em>tagName</em> and <em>sequence</em> (it's an error occurs if there's no such binding) is returned. If both <em>command</em> and <em>sequence</em> are missing then a list of all the event sequences for which bindings have been defined for <em>tagName</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>button</strong> <em>operation</em> ?<em>args</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>This command is used to control the button selectors within a <strong>treeview</strong> widget. It has several forms, depending on <em>operation</em>:</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>button activate</strong> <em>tagOrId</em></dt>
<dd><p>Designates the node given by <em>tagOrId</em> as active. When a node is active it's entry is drawn using its active icon (see the <strong>-activeicon</strong> option). Note that there can be only one active entry at a time. The special id <strong>active</strong> indicates the currently active node.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>button bind</strong> <em>tagName</em> ?<em>sequence</em> <em>command</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Associates <em>command</em> with <em>tagName</em> such that whenever the event sequence given by <em>sequence</em> occurs for an button of a node entry with this tag, <em>command</em> will be invoked. The syntax is similar to the <strong>bind</strong> command except that it operates on <strong>treeview</strong> buttons, rather than widgets. See the <strong>bind</strong> manual entry for complete details on <em>sequence</em> and the substitutions performed on <em>command</em> before invoking it.</p>
<p>If all arguments are specified then a new binding is created, replacing any existing binding for the same <em>sequence</em> and <em>tagName</em>. If the first character of <em>command</em> is + then <em>command</em> augments an existing binding rather than replacing it. If no <em>command</em> argument is provided then the command currently associated with <em>tagName</em> and <em>sequence</em> (it's an error occurs if there's no such binding) is returned. If both <em>command</em> and <em>sequence</em> are missing then a list of all the event sequences for which bindings have been defined for <em>tagName</em>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>button cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the <strong>configure</strong> operation described below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>button configure</strong> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>value</em> <em>option</em> <em>value</em> <em>...</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options for <em>pathName</em> (see <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty string. <em>Option</em> and <em>value</em> are described in the section <strong>BUTTON OPTIONS</strong> below.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>cget</strong> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <em>option</em>. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the <strong>configure</strong> operation described below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>close</strong> ?<strong>-recurse</strong>? <em>tagOrId...</em></dt>
<dd><p>Closes the node specified by <em>tagOrId</em>. In addition, if a Tcl script was specified by the <strong>-closecommand</strong> option, it is invoked. If the node is already closed, this command has no effect. If the <strong>-recurse</strong> flag is present, each child node is recursively closed.</p>

<dd><p>The following operations are available for treeview columns.</p>
<dl>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>column activate</strong> <em>column</em></dt>
<dd><p>Sets the active column to <em>column</em>. <em>Column</em> is the name of a column in the widget. When a column is active, it's drawn using its <strong>-activetitlebackground</strong> and <strong>-activetitleforeground</strong> options. If <em>column</em> is the &quot;&quot;, then no column will be active. If no column argument is provided, then the name of the currently active column is returned.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>column cget</strong> <em>name</em> <em>option</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the current value of the column configuration option given by <em>option</em> for <em>name</em>. <em>Name</em> is the name of column that corresponds to a data field. <em>Option</em> may have any of the values accepted by the <strong>configure</strong> operation described below.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>column configure</strong> <em>name</em> ?<em>option</em>? ?<em>value</em> <em>option</em> <em>value</em> <em>...</em>?</dt>
<dd><p>Query or modify the configuration options of the column designated by <em>name</em>. <em>Name</em> is the name of the column corresponding to a data field. If no <em>option</em> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options for <em>pathName</em> (see <strong>Tk_ConfigureInfo</strong> for information on the format of this list). If <em>option</em> is specified with no <em>value</em>, then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no <em>option</em> is specified). If one or more <em>option-value</em> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty string. <em>Option</em> and <em>value</em> are described in the section <strong>COLUMN OPTIONS</strong> below.</p>

</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>column insert</strong> <em>position</em> <em>field</em> ?<em>options</em>...?</dt>
<dd><p>Inserts one of more columns designated by <em>field</em>. A column displays each node's data field by the same name. If the node doesn't have the given field, the cell is left blank. <em>Position</em> indicates where in the list of columns to add the new column. It may be either a number or end.</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pathName</em> <strong>column invoke</strong> <em>field</em></dt>

<h1 id="default-bindings">DEFAULT BINDINGS</h1>
<p>Tk automatically creates class bindings for treeviews that give them Motif-like behavior. Much of the behavior of a <strong>treeview</strong> widget is determined by its <strong>-selectmode</strong> option, which selects one of two ways of dealing with the selection.</p>
<p>If the selection mode is <strong>single</strong>, only one node can be selected at a time. Clicking button 1 on an node selects it and deselects any other selected item.</p>
<p>If the selection mode is <strong>multiple</strong>, any number of entries may be selected at once, including discontiguous ranges. Clicking Control- Button-1 on a node entry toggles its selection state without affecting any other entries. Pressing Shift-Button-1 on a node entry selects it, extends the selection.</p>
<dl>
<dt>[1]</dt>
<dd>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, the selected range can be adjusted by pressing button 1 with the Shift key down: this modifies the selection to consist of the entries between the anchor and the entry under the mouse, inclusive. The un-anchored end of this new selection can also be dragged with the button down.
</dd>
<dt>[2]</dt>
<dd>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, pressing button 1 with the Control key down starts a toggle operation: the anchor is set to the entry under the mouse, and its selection state is reversed. The selection state of other entries isn't changed. If the mouse is dragged with button 1 down, then the selection state of all entries between the anchor and the entry under the mouse is set to match that of the anchor entry; the selection state of all other entries remains what it was before the toggle operation began.
</dd>
<dt>[3]</dt>
<dd>If the mouse leaves the treeview window with button 1 down, the window scrolls away from the mouse, making information visible that used to be off-screen on the side of the mouse. The scrolling continues until the mouse re-enters the window, the button is released, or the end of the hierarchy is reached.
</dd>
<dt>[4]</dt>
<dd>Mouse button 2 may be used for scanning. If it is pressed and dragged over the <strong>treeview</strong> widget, the contents of the hierarchy drag at high speed in the direction the mouse moves.
</dd>
<dt>[5]</dt>
<dd>If the Up or Down key is pressed, the location cursor (active entry) moves up or down one entry. If the selection mode is <strong>browse</strong> or <strong>extended</strong> then the new active entry is also selected and all other entries are deselected. In <strong>extended</strong> mode the new active entry becomes the selection anchor.
</dd>
<dt>[6]</dt>
<dd>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, Shift-Up and Shift-Down move the location cursor (active entry) up or down one entry and also extend the selection to that entry in a fashion similar to dragging with mouse button 1.
</dd>
<dt>[7]</dt>
<dd>The Left and Right keys scroll the <strong>treeview</strong> widget view left and right by the width of the character <strong>0</strong>. Control-Left and Control-Right scroll the <strong>treeview</strong> widget view left and right by the width of the window. Control-Prior and Control-Next also scroll left and right by the width of the window.
</dd>
<dt>[8]</dt>
<dd>The Prior and Next keys scroll the <strong>treeview</strong> widget view up and down by one page (the height of the window).
</dd>
<dt>[9]</dt>
<dd>The Home and End keys scroll the <strong>treeview</strong> widget horizontally to the left and right edges, respectively.
</dd>
<dt>[10]</dt>
<dd>Control-Home sets the location cursor to the the first entry, selects that entry, and deselects everything else in the widget.
</dd>
<dt>[11]</dt>
<dd>Control-End sets the location cursor to the the last entry, selects that entry, and deselects everything else in the widget.
</dd>
<dt>[12]</dt>
<dd>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, Control-Shift-Home extends the selection to the first entry and Control-Shift-End extends the selection to the last entry.
</dd>
<dt>[13]</dt>
<dd>In <strong>multiple</strong> mode, Control-Shift-Home moves the location cursor to the first entry and Control-Shift-End moves the location cursor to the last entry.
</dd>
<dt>[14]</dt>
<dd>The space and Select keys make a selection at the location cursor (active entry) just as if mouse button 1 had been pressed over this entry.
</dd>
<dt>[15]</dt>
<dd>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, Control-Shift-space and Shift-Select extend the selection to the active entry just as if button 1 had been pressed with the Shift key down.
</dd>
<dt>[16]</dt>
<dd>In <strong>extended</strong> mode, the Escape key cancels the most recent selection and restores all the entries in the selected range to their previous selection state.
</dd>
<dt>[17]</dt>
<dd>Control-slash selects everything in the widget, except in <strong>single</strong> and <strong>browse</strong> modes, in which case it selects the active entry and deselects everything else.
</dd>
<dt>[18]</dt>
<dd>Control-backslash deselects everything in the widget, except in <strong>browse</strong> mode where it has no effect.
</dd>
<dt>[19]</dt>
<dd>The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies the selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a selection.

<h1 id="example">EXAMPLE</h1>
<p>The <strong>treeview</strong> command creates a new widget.</p>
<pre><code>treeview .h -bg white</code></pre>
<p>A new Tcl command .h is also created. This command can be used to query and modify the <strong>treeview</strong> widget. For example, to change the background color of the table to &quot;green&quot;, you use the new command and the widget's <strong>configure</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code># Change the background color.
.h configure -background &quot;green&quot;</code></pre>
<p>By default, the <strong>treeview</strong> widget will automatically create a new tree object to contain the data. The name of the new tree is the pathname of the widget. Above, the new tree object name is &quot;.h&quot;. But you can use the <strong>-tree</strong> option to specify the name of another tree.</p>
<pre><code># View the tree &quot;myTree&quot;.
.h configure -tree &quot;myTree&quot;</code></pre>
<p>When a new tree is created, it contains only a root node. The node is automatically opened. The id of the root node is always 0 (you can use also use the special id root). The <strong>insert</strong> operation lets you insert one or more new entries into the tree. The last argument is the node's <em>pathname</em>.</p>
<pre><code># Create a new entry named &quot;myEntry&quot;
set id [.h insert end &quot;myEntry&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>This appends a new node named &quot;myEntry&quot;. It will positioned as the last child of the root of the tree (using the position &quot;end&quot;). You can supply another position to order the node within its siblings.</p>
<pre><code># Prepend &quot;fred&quot;.
set id [.h insert 0 &quot;fred&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Entry names do not need to be unique. By default, the node's label is its name. To supply a different text label, add the <strong>-label</strong> option.</p>
<pre><code># Create a new node named &quot;fred&quot;
set id [.h insert end &quot;fred&quot; -label &quot;Fred Flintstone&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>insert</strong> operation returns the id of the new node. You can also use the <strong>index</strong> operation to get this information.</p>
<pre><code># Get the id of &quot;fred&quot;
.h index &quot;fred&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To insert a node somewhere other than root, use the <strong>-at</strong> switch. It takes the id of the node where the new child will be added.</p>
<pre><code># Create a new node &quot;barney&quot; in &quot;fred&quot;.
.h insert -at $id end &quot;barney&quot;</code></pre>
<p>A pathname describes the path to an entry in the hierarchy. It's a list of entry names that compose the path in the tree. Therefore, you can also add &quot;barney&quot; to &quot;fred&quot; as follows.</p>
<pre><code># Create a new sub-entry of &quot;fred&quot;
.h insert end &quot;fred barney&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Every name in the list is ancestor of the next. All ancestors must already exist. That means that an entry &quot;fred&quot; is an ancestor of &quot;barney&quot; and must already exist. But you can use the <strong>-autocreate</strong> configuration option to force the creation of ancestor nodes.</p>
<pre><code># Force the creation of ancestors.
.h configure -autocreate yes
.h insert end &quot;fred barney wilma betty&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes the pathname is already separated by a character sequence rather than formed as a list. A file name is a good example of this. You can use the <strong>-separator</strong> option to specify a separator string to split the path into its components. Each pathname inserted is automatically split using the separator string as a separator. Multiple separators are treated as one.</p>
<pre><code>.h configure -separator /
.h insert end &quot;/usr/local/tcl/bin&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If the path is prefixed by extraneous characters, you can automatically trim it off using the <strong>-trim</strong> option. It removed the string from the path before it is parsed.</p>
<pre><code>.h configure -trim C:/windows -separator /
.h insert end &quot;C:/window/system&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can insert more than one entry at a time with the <strong>insert</strong> operation. This can be much faster than looping over a list of names.</p>
<pre><code># The slow way
foreach f [glob $dir/*] {
    .h insert end $f
}
# The fast way
eval .h insert end [glob $dir/*]</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the <strong>insert</strong> operation will return a list of ids of the new entries.</p>
<p>You can delete entries with the <strong>delete</strong> operation. It takes one or more tags of ids as its argument. It deletes the entry and all its children.</p>
<pre><code>.h delete $id</code></pre>
<p>Entries have several configuration options. They control the appearance of the entry's icon and label. We have already seen the <strong>-label</strong> option that sets the entry's text label. The <strong>entry configure</strong> operation lets you set or modify an entry's configuration options.</p>
<pre><code>.h entry configure $id -color red -font fixed</code></pre>
<p>You can hide an entry and its children using the <strong>-hide</strong> option.</p>
<pre><code>.h entry configure $id -hide yes</code></pre>
<p>More that one entry can be configured at once. All entries specified are configured with the same options.</p>
<pre><code>.h entry configure $i1 $i2 $i3 $i4 -color brown</code></pre>
<p>An icon is displayed for each entry. It's a Tk image drawn to the left of the label. You can set the icon with the entry's <strong>-icons</strong> option. It takes a list of two image names: one to represent the open entry, another when it is closed.</p>
<pre><code>set im1 [image create photo -file openfolder.gif]
set im2 [image create photo -file closefolder.gif]
.h entry configure $id -icons &quot;$im1 $im2&quot;</code></pre>
<p>If <strong>-icons</strong> is set to the empty string, no icons are display.</p>
<p>If an entry has children, a button is displayed to the left of the icon. Clicking the mouse on this button opens or closes the sub- hierarchy. The button is normally a + or - symbol, but can be configured in a variety of ways using the <strong>button configure</strong> operation. For example, the + and - symbols can be replaced with Tk images.</p>
<pre><code>set im1 [image create photo -file closefolder.gif]
set im2 [image create photo -file downarrow.gif]
.h button configure $id -images &quot;$im1 $im2&quot; \
    -openrelief raised -closerelief raised</code></pre>
<p>Entries can contain an arbitrary number of <em>data</em> <em>fields</em>. Data fields are name-value pairs. Both the value and name are strings. The entry's <strong>-data</strong> option lets you set data fields.</p>
<pre><code>.h entry configure $id -data {mode 0666 group users}</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>-data</strong> takes a list of name-value pairs.</p>
<p>You can display these data fields as <em>columns</em> in the <strong>treeview</strong> widget. You can create and configure columns with the <strong>column</strong> operation. For example, to add a new column to the widget, use the <strong>column insert</strong> operation. The last argument is the name of the data field that you want to display.</p>
<pre><code>.h column insert end &quot;mode&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The column title is displayed at the top of the column. By default, it's is the field name. You can override this using the column's <strong>-text</strong> option.</p>
<pre><code>.h column insert end &quot;mode&quot; -text &quot;File Permissions&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Columns have several configuration options. The <strong>column configure</strong> operation lets you query or modify column options.</p>
<pre><code>.h column configure &quot;mode&quot; -justify left</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>-justify</strong> option says how the data is justified within in the column. The <strong>-hide</strong> option indicates whether the column is displayed.</p>
<pre><code>.h column configure &quot;mode&quot; -hide yes</code></pre>
<p>Entries can be selected by clicking on the mouse. Selected entries are drawn using the colors specified by the <strong>-selectforeground</strong> and <strong>-selectbackground</strong> configuration options. The selection itself is managed by the <strong>selection</strong> operation.</p>
<pre><code># Clear all selections
.h selection clear 0 end
# Select the root node
.h selection set 0</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>curselection</strong> operation returns a list of ids of all the selected entries.</p>
<pre><code>set ids [.h curselection]</code></pre>
<p>You can use the <strong>get</strong> operation to convert the ids to their pathnames.</p>
<pre><code>set names [eval .h get -full $ids]</code></pre>
<p>If a treeview is exporting its selection (using the <strong>-exportselection</strong> option), then it will observe the standard X11 protocols for handling the selection. Treeview selections are available as type <strong>STRING</strong>; the value of the selection will be the pathnames of the selected entries, separated by newlines.</p>
<p>The <strong>treeview</strong> supports two modes of selection: single and multiple. In single select mode, only one entry can be selected at a time, while multiple select mode allows several entries to be selected. The mode is set by the widget's <strong>-selectmode</strong> option.</p>
<pre><code>.h configure -selectmode &quot;multiple&quot;</code></pre>
<p>You can be notified when the list of selected entries changes. The widget's <strong>-selectcommand</strong> specifies a Tcl procedure that is called whenever the selection changes.</p>
<pre><code>proc SelectNotify { widget } {
   set ids [$widget curselection]
}
.h configure -selectcommand &quot;SelectNotify .h&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The widget supports the standard Tk scrolling and scanning operations. The <strong>treeview</strong> can be both horizontally and vertically. You can attach scrollbars to the <strong>treeview</strong> the same way as the listbox or canvas widgets.</p>
<pre><code>scrollbar .xbar -orient horizontal -command &quot;.h xview&quot;
scrollbar .ybar -orient vertical -command &quot;.h yview&quot;
.h configure -xscrollcommand &quot;.xbar set&quot; \
    -yscrollcommand &quot;.ybar set&quot;</code></pre>
<p>There are three different modes of scrolling: listbox, canvas, and hierbox. In listbox mode, the last entry can always be scrolled to the top of the widget. In hierbox mode, the last entry is always drawn at the bottom of the widget. The scroll mode is set by the widget's <strong>-selectmode</strong> option.</p>
<pre><code>.h configure -scrollmode &quot;listbox&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Entries can be programmatically opened or closed using the <strong>open</strong> and <strong>close</strong> operations respectively.</p>
<pre><code>.h open $id
.h close $id</code></pre>
<p>When an entry is opened, a Tcl procedure can be automatically invoked. The <strong>-opencommand</strong> option specifies this procedure. This procedure can lazily insert entries as needed.</p>
<pre><code>proc AddEntries { dir } {
   eval .h insert end [glob -nocomplain $dir/*]
}
.h configure -opencommand &quot;AddEntries %P&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now when an entry is opened, the procedure AddEntries is called and adds children to the entry. Before the command is invoked, special &quot;%&quot; substitutions (like <strong>bind</strong>) are performed. Above, %P is translated to the pathname of the entry.</p>
<p>The same feature exists when an entry is closed. The <strong>-closecommand</strong> option specifies the procedure.</p>
<pre><code>proc DeleteEntries { id } {
   .h entry delete $id 0 end
}
.h configure -closecommand &quot;DeleteEntries %#&quot;</code></pre>
<p>When an entry is closed, the procedure DeleteEntries is called and deletes the entry's children using the <strong>entry delete</strong> operation (%# is the id of entry).</p>
